The player is driving a morphing combat vehicle capable of numerous weapon loadouts, acquired by destroying trucks carrying power-ups. These power-ups increase the firepower of the player's car, as well as extending their life bar and other bonuses.</p><p>The game has an unusual cheat built in: If the player configures the cursor on the continue menu (found after losing all their lives), they can play a fast-paced game of Pong against a CPU opponent. If they win, they resume the game with 20 lives instead of the usual five. If they lose, they resume with zero extra lives.</p><p>For its US release, SunSoft acquired the Spy Hunter license and promoted the game as a Spy Hunter sequel, but the game wasn't initially affiliated with Spy Hunter in any way.

Because of the relatively large storage capacity of the laserdisc, Cinematronics were able to create a game that featured higher fidelity graphics than other contemporary games. It was also a highly influential title of its time, opening the floodgates to several other laserdisc titles, such as <a href=\"/space-ace/3030-463/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-463\">Space Ace</a>, <a href=\"/begas-battle/3030-36549/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-36549\">Bega's Battle</a>, and <a href=\"/cliff-hanger/3030-18849/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18849\">Cliff Hanger</a>.</p><h2>Story</h2><p>Dragon's Lair puts players in the greaves of Dirk the Daring, a knight trying to rescue the Princess Daphne.

The QTE-focused game only appears on certain platforms, in this variation of the game players watch and sometimes control Dirk through his adventures though Singe's castle. At very specific intervals during the game, Dirk will be in a situation that will force the player to control him, choosing which to direction to move him in around or having him attack enemies. Each of these sequences would trigger a new scene in the movie to start playing, similar to the way a DVD can have different \"chapters\" to select at any time. Choosing the right action in these confrontations would cause Dirk to circumnavigate his obstacle with aplomb, while choosing the wrong action would trigger a sequence in which Dirk is killed. The player is helped out by some degree of input clues such as flashing lights letting them know the direction to push. Added help to these sequences was added in the iPhone version which by default causes the on screen controls to flash the correct input, although this feature can be turned of if desired. The limited, simple button pressing gameplay set to cinematic action that would later evolve into the <a href=\"/quick-time-event/3015-6/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6\">Quick Time Event</a>, featured in games like <a href=\"/shenmue/3030-7812/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7812\">Shenmue</a>, <a href=\"/resident-evil-4/3030-1578/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1578\">Resident Evil 4</a>, and <a href=\"/heavy-rain/3030-21304/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21304\">Heavy Rain</a>.</p><p>In the original arcade version, the castle's rooms were presented in a semi-randomized order. The player would advance to a new room regardless of whether they could complete the previous one, however before the final confrontation with the dragon, the player would be required to replay the scenes they failed. In addition many of the rooms played \"in reverse\" (meaning, a jump to the left became a jump to the right the second time a scene played) meaning that even if one were to memorize every room in the castle they would still have to keep a keen eye on the layout of each room. The high score table was usually part of a separate cabinet extension.</p><p>An experienced player who memorized every input for every scene could complete the game in less than 10 minutes. These experienced players soon realized that the player's score was increased with every successful input, regardless if the scene ended in success or failure. Thus, the score could be inflated by purposely dying before the last move of a long scene, and saving the last \"life\" for the final scene with the dragon. As new lives were rewarded throughout the game, these players could extend their play time to 20 minutes or more on one credit.</p><h2>Development</h2><p>Dragon\u2019s Lair was the brain child of <a href=\"/rick-dyer/3040-47901/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-47901\">Rick Dyer</a>, president of Advanced Microcomputer Systems, who, supposedly, realized that video games needed top quality animation during a viewing of the animated film The Secret of NIMH. He also claims that the Atari 2600 classic \u201cAdventure\u201d was another inspiration for Dragon\u2019s Lair. The entire game was animated by Disney Animator Don Bluth at his personal studio. The game was made in less than 7 months for a mere one million dollars (cheap considering the work they were doing with new technology). The animators on the game couldn\u2019t afford to hire real models to provide an appropriate frame for the Princess Daphne, so Cinematronic\u2019s team apparently used Playboy magazines as an inspiration.</p><h2>Xbox Live Arcade Port</h2><p>On March 19th, 2012 it was announced that Dragon's Lair was coming to <a href=\"/xbox-live-marketplace/3045-86/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-86\">Xbox Live Arcade</a>.

The opening of the game features an animated cinematic of the opening scene of the film. After that the player takes control of <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1062\" href=\"/luke-skywalker/3005-1062/\" slug=\"luke-skywalker\"> Luke Skywalker</a>, driving the  landspeeder across <a data-ref-id=\"3035-319\" href=\"/tatooine/3035-319/\" slug=\"tatooine\"> Tatooine</a> in search of  R2-D2.\u00a0 <br/>\u00a0<br/>Luke Skywalker explores various locations throughout Tatooine, fighting numerous enemies including Jawas and Stormtroopers. The game features many locations from the movie\u00a0including the Chalmun's Cantina in Mos Eisley where Luke meets Han Solo for the first time. This section of the game features a classic 8-bit rendition of the \"Cantina Band\" theme as played by the fictitious band, Figrin D'an and the Modal Nodes, in the feature film. The game also contains many famous lines from the movie including Obi-Wan Kenobi's plea to Luke to join him in his trip to Alderann and Han Solo's description of the smell from the Death Star's trash compactor.\u00a0 <br/>\u00a0<br/>The player eventually lands on the <a data-ref-id=\"3035-205\" href=\"/death-star/3035-205/\" slug=\"death-star\"> Death Star</a> and has to destroy the tractor beam to escape.

The finale of the game features a top down view of Luke Skywalker's X-Wing flying through the Death Star trenches. After the player successfully fires a torpedo into the Death Star's exposed exhaust port, a cinematic of the Death Star exploding and Luke Skywalker being awarded a medal on Yavin IV is shown.\u00a0<br/><br/>The game featured the characters Luke Skywalker, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-3260\" href=\"/han-solo/3005-3260/\" slug=\"han-solo\"> Han Solo</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-669\" href=\"/obi-wan-kenobi/3005-669/\" slug=\"obi-wan-kenobi\"> Obi-Wan Kenobi</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-4673\" href=\"/princess-leia-organa-solo/3005-4673/\" slug=\"princess-leia-organa-solo\"> Princess Leia</a>, R2-D2, and C-3PO.

First released in arcades in 1984, the NES version was released in 1985. Unusually for a Nintendo developed property post the launch of the NES/Famicom, Balloon Fight was also ported to Japanese home computers the <a href=\"/nec-pc-8801/3045-109/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-109\">NEC PC88-01</a> and the <a href=\"/sharp-x1/3045-113/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-113\">Sharp X1</a>.</p><p>Gameplay consists of either one player or two-player co-op mode, and the goal of the main game is to defeat all enemies on screen to clear each level. The player is given three lives at the beginning of each game. There is also a Balloon Trip mode that tasks a player's reflexes by presenting an obstacle course full of hazards.</p><p>The game was later added to the Wii Virtual Console, the Wii U Virtual Console and the 3DS eShop. It is also present in the first <a href=\"/nes-remix/3030-44783/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-44783\">NES Remix</a> from indieszero as one of the featured games.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15568/625746-balloon_fight_25.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-625746\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 512px\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"512\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15568/625746-balloon_fight_25.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-625746\"><img alt=\"The Main Game Mode\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15568/625746-balloon_fight_25.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15568/625746-balloon_fight_25.png 512w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/15568/625746-balloon_fight_25.png 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15568/625746-balloon_fight_25.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>The Main Game Mode</figcaption></figure><p>The player character is a person with two balloons strapped to their back. The player must hit either the A or B buttons to flap the character's hands to fly about the stage, attacking enemies by landing on their backs and popping their balloons. Enemies are defeated by popping both of their balloons, and then landing on them while they are on the ground (in order to prevent them from inflating another balloon). There is also a body of water in the center of each level. If an enemy or player falls into the water or floats too close to the water, a large fish jumps from the water and eats the character. A spinning bumper-blade appears in the later levels as an added obstacle.</p><p>Between every three normal levels, a bonus stage occurs. In the bonus stage, the player attempts to burst a large number of balloons as they float up from the bottom of the screen. If all 20 balloons are collected, a large bonus is added to the player's score. Following each bonus stage, the player is also rewarded with a full complement of two balloons.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15568/625711-balloon_fight_9.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-625711\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 512px\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"512\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15568/625711-balloon_fight_9.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-625711\"><img alt=\"Balloon Trip\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15568/625711-balloon_fight_9.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15568/625711-balloon_fight_9.png 512w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/15568/625711-balloon_fight_9.png 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15568/625711-balloon_fight_9.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Balloon Trip\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15568/625711-balloon_fight_9.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15568/625711-balloon_fight_9.png 512w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/15568/625711-balloon_fight_9.png 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15568/625711-balloon_fight_9.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Balloon Trip</figcaption></figure><p>The game also features a single-player mode called \"Balloon Trip\" where the player moves across a side-scrolling level, avoiding lightning bolts and gathering balloons.

Despite the fact that the game already had packaging and was in a shippable state, the game never saw a commercial release.

After every two levels, which culminate in a corresponding <a data-ref-id=\"3015-50\" href=\"/boss-fight/3015-50/\" slug=\"boss-fight\">boss fight</a>, the playable CheetahMan is switched out. Each one has a weapon which they can use to defeat enemies. However, because some enemies lie low to the ground, the CheetahMen are unable to attack them due to their inability to kneel and duck.

For example, in the first level, if the player turns left and jumps twice, the CheetahMan becomes <a data-ref-id=\"3015-317\" href=\"/invisibility/3015-317/\" slug=\"invisibility\">invisibile</a> and also partially enters the ground. Additionally, when playing as the second CheetahMan, it is possible to <a data-ref-id=\"3015-379\" href=\"/jump/3015-379/\" slug=\"jump\">jump</a> in such a way that he reaches the sky and then <a data-ref-id=\"3015-8\" href=\"/teleportation/3015-8/\" slug=\"teleportation\">teleports</a> to the bottom of the screen. The most major glitches, however, involve the boss battle with the Ape Man. Besides the fact that Ape Man actually causes no damage and simply runs through the same animation, it is impossible to finish the game under normal circumstances after defeating him. The CheetahMan is simply stuck at that screen. Additional levels which are meant to take place after that fight can be accessed, but they require the use of cheating devices.</p>", "expected_release_day": null, "expected_release_month": null, "expected_release_quarter": null, "expected_release_year": null, "guid": "3030-244", "id": 244, "image": {"icon_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/833039-154_1.jpg", "medium_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_medium/833039-154_1.jpg", "screen_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/screen_medium/833039-154_1.jpg", "screen_large_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/screen_kubrick/833039-154_1.jpg", "small_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_small/833039-154_1.jpg", "super_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_large/833039-154_1.jpg", "thumb_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_avatar/833039-154_1.jpg", "tiny_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_mini/833039-154_1.jpg", "original_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/833039-154_1.jpg", "image_tags": "All Images,Box Art"}, "image_tags": [{"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-244/?filter=image_tag%3AAll+Images", "name": "All Images", "total": 6}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-244/?filter=image_tag%3ABox+Art", "name": "Box Art", "total": 1}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-244/?filter=image_tag%3ANES+Screenshots", "name": "NES Screenshots", "total": 5}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-244/?filter=image_tag%3AScreenshots", "name": "Screenshots", "total": 5}], "name": "CheetahMen II", "number_of_user_reviews": 0, "original_game_rating": null, "original_release_date": null, "platforms": [{"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-21/", "id": 21, "name": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/nintendo-entertainment-system/3045-21/", "abbreviation": "NES"}], "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/cheetahmen-ii/3030-244/"}, {"aliases": null, "api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-274/", "date_added": "2008-04-01 01:36:05", "date_last_updated": "2017-03-23 02:24:49", "deck": "A NES platformer where you play as Fred Flintstone as his pets Dino and Hoppy are kidnapped by a collector from the future.

Save all the imprisoned humans with a tricked-out pink submarine.", "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Sqoon is a video game for the <a href=\"/nes/3045-21/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-21\">Nintendo Entertainment System</a> and published by <a href=\"/irem-corp/3010-461/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-461\"> Irem</a> and developed by <a href=\"/home-data-corp/3010-462/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-462\"> Home Data</a>. It is a side scrolling style of game where a pink submarine must defend Earth from the evil aliens of Neptune. At the same time the player must attempt to rescue human survivors and drop them on an island. It had very little adoption in North American and thus was considered a flop. </p><h2>Plot</h2><p>Earth is being attacked by the <a href=\"/neptunians/3015-4869/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4869\">Neptunians</a>, an underwater race of alien beings. They do this by melting the polar ice caps, flooding every country across the world. The Neptunians did this because their source of food, man-ham, was depleting due to meteorites turning their world into a desert. So they moved to Earth because of its abundant source of man-ham. </p><p>While all of this was taking place, a pirate named <a href=\"/narikeen/3040-97878/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-97878\">Narikeen</a> was mining gold under the oceans of the world using his submarine, named <a href=\"/sqoon/3055-3549/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-3549\">SQOON</a>. When his SQOON was full of gold, he would go into port and trade his gold for grog. But when he tried to go to the port, he realized that it was gone. In fact, all the land was gone! </p><p>It was then when he received a message on the radio from the General of the Earth Defense Army warning Narikeen of the Neptunian invasion of the planet Earth. After refusing at first, Narikeen finally agrees to save the trapped humans underwater with his SQOON. He can only carry nine people at a time, transferring them from the underwater base to his motorized floating island. </p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Sqoon borrows plenty of ideas from <a href=\"/gradius/3030-15508/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15508\">Gradius</a>, and lays out a lot of ground for Irem's big shooter series, <a href=\"/r-type/3025-419/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-419\">R-Type</a>. The game is a classic example of the side-scrolling shooter genre. What separates Sqoon from the rest is its upgrade system, which requires the player release the captured humans, capture nine of them, and successfully stow them away on a motorized floating island in order to upgrade the SQOON's guns. The main gun has two upgrades. The secondary gun is the classic \"below fire\" gun, which is used to break open ocean bottom domes, freeing humans. </p><p>Another unique gameplay feature found in Sqoon is the fuel meter. In order to keep moving forward, the player needs to constantly replenish the fuel meter, which starts out at sixty. Fuel is lost every second. In order to replenish fuel, the player is given a refill of fuel every time they rescue nine prisoners. They can also gain a full refill by killing one of the crabs on the ground, and exchanging what the crab leaves behind on the motorized floating island. Also on the top left, there is a score counter. </p><h2>Upgrades</h2><h3>Starting Weapons: </h3><ul><li>Horizon Missile - Kills the Neptunians</li><li>Ice Ball Gun - Destroys bio hot water factory and enemies. When the ocean bottom dome is broken with the iceball gun, the humans come swimming out. They need to be rescued quickly and transferred to the small motorized island to receive energy for SQOON.</li></ul><h3>Upgraded Weapons: </h3><ul><li>Bow-wow missile - The first power-up, the SQOON's main weapon will be upgraded to the Bob-wow missile. It moves at the same speed as the horizon missile, but it goes through enemies, allowing it to hit any remaining enemies behind it.</li><li>Adenoid missile - If the player has the Bow-wow missile and power-up again, they will receive this weapon. It is the most powerful missile available, giving the SQOON a spread-shot. </li></ul><h2>Worlds</h2><ol><li>Japan</li><li>China</li><li>India</li><li>Saudi Arabia</li><li>Switzerland</li><li>Hungary</li><li>United States</li><li>Dreamland </li></ol><h2>Enemies</h2><p>All information is from the games' manual:</p><blockquote><p>Sea Slug: Look for it around the cities. It picks up the magic necklace that the mermaid Kazumi has dropped. If you hit it with the ice ball a number of times, it will turn into a necklace. If you pick up this necklace and destroy the bio hot water factory the balance of ocean energy will be disturbed and you may be able to go to some other dimension of the world. This is a magical lifeform.</p><p>Crab: If you shoot it with the ice ball gun, the shell of the crab comes off and you can get the gold inside. Touch the gold to collect it. In a few seconds though, the shell will return and the crab will start walking again. Use your gold well. One gold and one person allows you to refuel from the small motorized island.</p><p>Flounder: This is the Neptunian scout. If you are killed by this, you're not doing very well. The Pirame dance around the screen.</p><p>Ottotto: Baruban (the ruler of the Neptunians) asked someone to create a smart robot, but this is the result. This is a smart robot that needs more brains.</p><p>Turtle: Get away, get away! This turtle is coming! Try to steer clear of this enemy.</p><p>Neptunian Mine: Avoid the mines floating in the ocean. You can destroy them with the ice ball gun.</p><p>Kazumi: Baruban turned Miss Neptune into a mermaid when they reached Earth to confuse the Earth people. However, Kazumi is innocent Miss Neptune. What should you do?</p><p>Snail: It used to be a toy for Yarukisu, the son of Baruban. Don't restrain your attack just because it's a child's toy.</p><p>Spear Shellfish: This is the guard for the Neptunians base. Its thick and hard shell is indestructible, even with horizon missles or ice balls. Avoid them.</p><p>Sunfish: It's the only bio-fish that has a family. It spends all of its time looking for food for the mambouya (little mambo).</p><p>Child Mambo: Don't restrain your attack just because this is a little mambo. It's brave and quick.</p><p>Angler Fish: Look out! This fish swims extremely fast and straight.</p><p>Squid: This creature rushes forward suddenly and then stops when it moves. It doesn't play fair-be careful!</p><p>Flying Fish: JUMP-JUMP-JUMP! If this is around, you can't get close to the surface of the ocean.</p><p>Nautilus Shell: It takes three horizon missiles to kill this enemy. If something is spinning and coming, it must be Paachiki.</p><p>Frog: This amphibian is expressionless because it's actually a statue of a sitting frog.</p><p>Shrimp: It looks strong, but it can be killed with the ice ball gun. It makes good sushi.</p><p>Sea Horse: This is a lost sea horse child, looking for its mother across the oceans.</p><p>Neptunian Ghosts: This is a strange ghost which followed Baruban from the planet Neptune.</p><p>Shellfish: If this sees an enemy, it wants to kill, Look out!</p><p><a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/shark/3015-1466/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1466\">Shark</a>: It's the only Earth fish which has been conquered by the Neptunians. It knows that if it follows SQOON, it can get food. It's a man-eating shark.</p></blockquote><h2>Extra</h2><ul><li>Every time the player passes a church, touch a surfer, panda bear, etc., they receive a 1UP.</li><li>Throughout the game's quest, the player travels throughout many major countries in the world, including the USA and China.</li></ul>", "expected_release_day": 26, "expected_release_month": 6, "expected_release_quarter": null, "expected_release_year": 1986, "guid": "3030-309", "id": 309, "image": {"icon_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/1039159-587640_39784_front.jpg", "medium_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_medium/1039159-587640_39784_front.jpg", "screen_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/screen_medium/1039159-587640_39784_front.jpg", "screen_large_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/screen_kubrick/1039159-587640_39784_front.jpg", "small_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_small/1039159-587640_39784_front.jpg", "super_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_large/1039159-587640_39784_front.jpg", "thumb_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_avatar/1039159-587640_39784_front.jpg", "tiny_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_mini/1039159-587640_39784_front.jpg", "original_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/1039159-587640_39784_front.jpg", "image_tags": "All Images,Box Art"}, "image_tags": [{"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-309/?filter=image_tag%3AAll+Images", "name": "All Images", "total": 9}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-309/?filter=image_tag%3ABox+Art", "name": "Box Art", "total": 3}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-309/?filter=image_tag%3ANES+Screenshots", "name": "NES Screenshots", "total": 5}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-309/?filter=image_tag%3AScreenshots", "name": "Screenshots", "total": 6}], "name": "Sqoon", "number_of_user_reviews": 0, "original_game_rating": null, "original_release_date": null, "platforms": [{"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-21/", "id": 21, "name": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/nintendo-entertainment-system/3045-21/", "abbreviation": "NES"}], "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/sqoon/3030-309/"}, {"aliases": "Arcade Archives: Donkey Kong", "api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-311/", "date_added": "2008-04-01 01:36:11", "date_last_updated": "2019-04-10 12:44:23", "deck": "Control Jumpman (later known as Mario) and save his girlfriend, Pauline, from the evil barrel-tossing gorilla known as Donkey Kong.

The company's president back in 1981, <a href=\"/hiroshi-yamauchi/3040-615/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-615\">Hiroshi Yamauchi</a>, made the decision to take a Nintendo arcade release called <a href=\"/radar-scope/3030-20776/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20776\">Radar Scope</a> (a hit game in Japan that floundered in the States) and see if it could be easily retrofitted to play a different, and hopefully more successful, game. To accomplish this task, Yamauchi chose a young employee named <a href=\"/shigeru-miyamoto/3040-614/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-614\">Shigeru Miyamoto</a>.</p><p>The basic story of the game is that Donkey Kong is Jumpman's pet. Jumpman mistreats Donkey Kong, who snaps and kidnaps Pauline and, in a decidedly King Kong-like twist, takes her up a building under construction. Jumpman must navigate four different levels, climbing to the top to either force Donkey Kong to move on or, in the stunning final confrontation, bring the building's girders down to make the big monkey fall.</p><p>Donkey Kong was followed-up by <a href=\"/donkey-kong-jr/3030-19416/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19416\">Donkey Kong Jr.</a> , which puts the player in the role of Donkey Kong's son, <a href=\"/donkey-kong-jr/3005-298/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-298\">Donkey Kong Jr.</a>, who must attempt to rescue his father from the clutches of the evil Jumpman, who by then had already been renamed <a href=\"/mario/3005-177/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-177\">Mario</a>.</p><p> </p><h2>Development</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15568/493144-donkey_kong_2.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-493144\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"512\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 512px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15568/493144-donkey_kong_2.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-493144\"><img alt=\"The Second Level\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15568/493144-donkey_kong_2.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15568/493144-donkey_kong_2.png 512w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/15568/493144-donkey_kong_2.png 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15568/493144-donkey_kong_2.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>The Second Level</figcaption></figure><p>Upon going to work, Miyamoto's first attempt was to make a game based on the then-popular <a href=\"/popeye/3005-6403/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-6403\">Popeye</a> character. The licensing deal was not pursued by Nintendo, though the company would later secure the license and develop a popular <a href=\"/popeye/3030-14419/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14419\">Popeye arcade game</a>. Miyamoto had to retrofit his concept and develop three characters with similar relations to Popeye, <a href=\"/olive-oyl/3005-7366/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-7366\">Olive Oyl</a>, and <a href=\"/bluto/3005-7365/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-7365\">Bluto</a>. He came up with a little man with a mustache that was quickly named <a href=\"/mario/3005-177/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-177\">Jumpman</a>, who had to save his girlfriend, <a href=\"/pauline/3005-1246/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1246\">Pauline</a>, from the evil gorilla named <a href=\"/donkey-kong/3005-299/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-299\">Donkey Kong</a>. After designing the concept Miyamoto approached his more colleague <a href=\"/gunpei-yokoi/3040-45151/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-45151\">Gunpei Yokoi</a> who would assist the young designer by supervising the technical development of the project.</p><p>Unfortunately due to the technical limitations in place not all of Miyamoto's ideas for the game were able to be included as concepts such as incorporating seesaws into the game or having the characters expressions more defined and animated were unable to be incremented into the game. These technical restrictions would ultimately have an effect on the character design of Jumpman as he was forced to make the character small whilst still making him look human. As such Miyamoto thought it best to give the character distinct features,</p><blockquote><p>\"such as giving him a big nose. We gave him a moustache so that we didn't need to draw a mouth, as it's often difficult to show facial expressions with small characters. We also gave him big hands.\"</p></blockquote><p>The name Donkey Kong was ultimately the decision of Miyamoto too. Wanting to give the impression of a stubborn, stupid gorilla he thought of animals which he thought were dim-witted and stubborn he came up with the idea of 'Donkey' which he believed to mean stupid. He also wished to incorporate the word 'Kong' into the title which in Japanese gives the idea of apes. Putting the two together the end result was \"Donkey Kong\". </p><h2>Legacy</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15568/493146-donkey_kong_4.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-493146\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"512\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 512px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15568/493146-donkey_kong_4.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-493146\"><img alt=\"The Final Level\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15568/493146-donkey_kong_4.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15568/493146-donkey_kong_4.png 512w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/15568/493146-donkey_kong_4.png 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15568/493146-donkey_kong_4.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Final Level\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15568/493146-donkey_kong_4.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15568/493146-donkey_kong_4.png 512w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/15568/493146-donkey_kong_4.png 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15568/493146-donkey_kong_4.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Final Level</figcaption></figure><p>Donkey Kong helped to create the platformer genre, and also was one of the first to include a story.

Donkey Kong also essentially launched Nintendo's biggest character of all-time, <a href=\"/mario/3005-177/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-177\">Mario</a>.</p><p>As a testament to the legacy of Donkey Kong, the documetary <i>King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters</i> was released in 2007, 26 years after the game's debut. The film was about gamer Steve Wiebe and his journey to defeat Billy Mitchell's high score, which had stood for 25 years. Public awareness about the competition for this score was raised by this film, and in the years since Wiebe, Mitchell, and others have traded positions on the top spot. Read more about the documentary at the <a href=\"http://www.billyvssteve.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">official site</a>.</p><p>In July 2009, Donkey Kong made news yet again when a 26-year-old <a href=\"/easter-egg/3015-2/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2\">easter egg</a>, which did nothing more than display the initials of Landon M. Dyer, who worked to code the title, was uncovered after Dyer mentioned that he had forgotten how to display the initials and offered $75 to whomever can find the Easter egg first. The $75 was awarded to Don Hodges after he dug through the game's code and found the way to display the initials.</p><h2>Donkey Kong: Original Edition</h2><p>In 2010, a special version of the <a href=\"/nes/3045-21/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-21\">NES</a> release of Donkey Kong was available to those in <a href=\"/europe/3035-289/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-289\">Europe</a> who purchased the special <a href=\"/super-mario-bros/3030-15544/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15544\">Super Mario Bros.</a> 25th anniversary <a href=\"/wii/3045-36/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-36\">Wii</a>. This version, subtitled \"Original Edition\", restored the missing \"pie factory\" stage as well as some animations. Although still not arcade-perfect, it was still much more than any edition released on the NES.</p><p>This edition of the game would not release in <a href=\"/japan/3035-37/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-37\">Japan</a> or the <a href=\"/the-united-states-of-america/3035-396/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-396\">United States</a> until 2012, and only then, on the <a href=\"/nintendo-3ds/3045-117/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-117\">3DS</a>. In Japan, it was a <a href=\"/pre-order-exclusive/3015-4695/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4695\">pre-order bonus</a> for <a href=\"/new-super-mario-bros-2/3030-38064/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-38064\">New Super Mario Bros. 2</a>. In The States, it is a bonus gift for players that purchase the <a href=\"/3dsware/3045-138/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-138\">digital download</a> versions of <a href=\"/art-academy-lessons-for-everyone/3030-38766/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-38766\">Art Academy: Lessons For Everyone!</a>, <a href=\"/paper-mario-sticker-star/3030-31755/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-31755\">Paper Mario: Sticker Star</a>, <a href=\"/professor-layton-and-the-miracle-mask/3030-29298/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-29298\">Professor Layton and the Miracle Mask</a>, <a href=\"/style-savvy-trendsetters/3030-39284/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-39284\">Style Savvy: Trendsetters</a>, or Crosswords Plus before January 6, 2013. It was made available to everyone for purchase on the European 3DS eShop on September 18, 2014.</p><h2>Trivia</h2><p>The first console port was licensed by Nintendo but not made by them. A near perfect arcade port, and pack-in, was created for the <a href=\"/colecovision/3045-47/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-47\">ColecoVision </a>system. This propelled its sales over the Atari 5200 and sold 500,000 units at launch. Over a year later <a href=\"/coleco/3010-302/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-302\">Coleco </a>made a version for its rival's Atari 2600. <a href=\"/sega/3010-62/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-62\">Sega</a> was also <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/01/business/video-games-to-to-hollywood.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">planning </a>to release a version with Coleco.</p><p>Falcon was licensed to distribute the game in Europe, which it did so with modified graphics and the name \"Crazy Kong\" (this is often mistaken to be a bootleg game). They did the same with the sequel <a href=\"/donkey-kong-jr/3030-19416/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19416\">Donkey Kong Junior</a>, as Crazy Kong Jr./Crazy Junior.</p><p> </p>", "expected_release_day": null,

based off of Oliver Stone's \"Platoon\".", "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Platoon is an action game based on the 1986 movie of the same name. Though the film carried a stringent anti-war message and was not an action movie in the traditional sense, the game adaptation is a Vietnam War set shooter. The protagonist, Chris Taylor (played by Charlie Sheen in the movie), must somehow survive the war despite being stuck between hostile North Vietnamese troops and the ruthless officers in command of his platoon.</p><p>The game was originally released on DOS and other home computers by Ocean Software, a British development and publishing studio that largely fared in poor quality license games. It was later ported to the NES by SunSoft.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>The game changes gameplay modes in every one of its four levels:</p><p>The first is a side-scrolling action type game in which the player must maneuver through a jungle maze in order to reach a bridge lined with explosives.</p><p>The second begins once the player finds the tunnels and switches to a first-person view.

The game is notable for pushing the graphical limitations of the Famicom's hardware.</p><p>The game's normal mode consists of four level, which, once completed unlocks a much harder 'second quest'.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>The player's ship, Recca, must navigate numerous enemy waves per stage culminating in a large boss encounter. To aid the player Recca may collect power-ups and option units that appear after defeating on screen enemies. Finally, Recca can store plasma energy by not firing its weapons. Plasma energy will build up over time indicated by a meter on the bottom of the screen. This forms a barrier in front of Recca which can absorb enemy bullets, however enemies can still collide with the player and destroy them. This energy can be launched creating a large explosion that can destroy enemy units and projectiles.</p><h3>Power-ups</h3><p>There are five power-ups that can be equipped by Recca altering the mechanics of its shot. By picking up multiple of the same power-up in a row their power and effects will increase.</p><ul><li><strong>Vulcan (V)</strong> - A spread shot upgrade that makes bullets fire in a wider arc.</li><li><strong>Laser (L)</strong> - A penetrative shot upgrade that allows bullets to continue through enemies.</li><li><strong>Beam (B)</strong> - An almost straight power upgrade to Recca's shots. Bullets travel straight forward, similar to default shots, but do more damage.</li><li><strong>Five Way (F)</strong> - Lowers firepower but shoots bullets in five directions around Recca.</li><li><strong>Homing (H)</strong> - Bullets will now track enemies upon being shot (normal mode only).</li></ul><h3>Option Units</h3><p>There are five option unites that can be equipped by Recca giving the player various types of shields that will absorb enemy bullets and provide additional firepower. By picking up multiple of the same options in a row their number will increase.</p><ul><li><strong>Option B</strong> - Flies behind Recca and will fire backwards.</li><li><strong>Option C</strong> - Moves and faces in the opposite direction Recca is traveling.</li><li><strong>Option R</strong> - Rotates around Recca automatically.</li><li><strong>Option F</strong> - Stays beside Recca's side and fires forwards.</li><li><strong>Option S</strong> - Moves and faces in the same direction Recca is traveling (normal mode only).</li></ul>", "expected_release_day": 17, "expected_release_month": 7, "expected_release_quarter": null, "expected_release_year": 1992, "guid": "3030-735", "id": 735, "image": {"icon_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/527785-recca.jpg", "medium_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_medium/527785-recca.jpg", "screen_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/screen_medium/527785-recca.jpg", "screen_large_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/screen_kubrick/527785-recca.jpg", "small_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_small/527785-recca.jpg", "super_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_large/527785-recca.jpg", "thumb_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_avatar/527785-recca.jpg", "tiny_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_mini/527785-recca.jpg", "original_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/527785-recca.jpg", "image_tags": "All Images,Box Art"}, "image_tags": [{"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-735/?filter=image_tag%3AAll+Images", "name": "All Images", "total": 17}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-735/?filter=image_tag%3ABox+Art", "name": "Box Art", "total": 1}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-735/?filter=image_tag%3ANES+Screenshots", "name": "NES Screenshots", "total": 6}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-735/?filter=image_tag%3AScreenshots", "name": "Screenshots", "total": 11}], "name": "Summer Carnival '92: Recca", "number_of_user_reviews": 0, "original_game_rating": [{"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-6/", "id": 6, "name": "ESRB: E"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-14/", "id": 14, "name": "OFLC: G"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-7/", "id": 7, "name": "PEGI: 3+"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-25/", "id": 25, "name": "CERO: A"}], "original_release_date": null, "platforms": [{"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-21/", "id": 21, "name": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/nintendo-entertainment-system/3045-21/", "abbreviation": "NES"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-138/", "id": 138, "name": "Nintendo 3DS eShop", "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/nintendo-3ds-eshop/3045-138/", "abbreviation": "3DSE"}], "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/summer-carnival-92-recca/3030-735/"}, {"aliases": null, "api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-753/", "date_added": "2008-04-01 01:37:30", "date_last_updated": "2015-11-24 17:13:52", "deck": "An early action-strategy-RPG game created by Koji Sumii and published by ASCII for the Sharp X1 computer in 1983.

The game is distinct for having multiple camera angles depending on where the wrestlers are in relation to the ring: there's an isometric view when the two combatants are outside of the ring and near one of the corners, for instance. Players choose four finishers from a menu before each bout, binding them to one of the four D-pad directions where they can be used whenever the opponent is briefly stunned. A finisher's strength is determined by a rapidly sliding scale that the player ideally hits when it is close to full.</p><p>The game was localized in North America as WCW: World Championship Wrestling and the wrestlers replaced with twelve then-active stars of the WCW circuit.

It was developed by many of the same people involved with <a data-ref-id=\"3030-4426\" href=\"/the-bards-tale-trilogy/3030-4426/\" slug=\"the-bards-tale-trilogy\"> the Bard's Tale</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-12134\" href=\"/wasteland/3030-12134/\" slug=\"wasteland\"> Wasteland </a>and as a result, shares many concepts and ideas from those titles within its design. It is also considered the spiritual successor to the Bard's Tale series, even so far as being referred to by some accounts as Bard's Tale IV, but because EA owned the rights to the name, Interplay had to create a new world from scratch. The box also featured art from artist Boris Vallejo with a poster copy inside and there were many references to Sumerian mythology within the game.<br/><br/>The game casts the player along with their party as prisoner exiles amidst the slums of the city of Purgatory. Originally on a pilgrimage to the land of Dilmun, the ship they were traveling on was immediately placed under arrest by the city when it came into port. The player and their party are among the lucky few not to be consigned as sacrifices to the dragons, but they are stripped of everything other than the rags on their backs and dumped into Purgatory's streets to survive on their own wits. It is up to the player to somehow find a way to survive and escape Purgatory and eventually seek revenge against Namtar, the Beast From The Pit, who seeks to dominate the world of Oceana.<br/><br/>In the world of Dragon Wars, dragons are considered as a form of nuclear deterrence albeit with a fantasy flavor. City-states scattered across the island nations of Oceana each have a dragon within their walls, kept under lock and key and fed well to protect their city from all rivals. A sort of \"Cold War\" exists where the dragons are held back and to be used only as the final option in war. Part of the mystery is why the city-states haven't yet used their dragons to strike back at Namtar's aggression as a united front.<br/><br/>Many of the gameplay systems are a hybrid of ideas from both Wasteland and the Bard's Tale. For example, while the game uses the ranged attack system present in both titles, it does not use classes and instead relies on the skill system first used by Interplay in Wasteland. The automapping feature used in titles such as <a data-ref-id=\"3030-2336\" href=\"/the-bards-tale-iii-thief-of-fate/3030-2336/\" slug=\"the-bards-tale-iii-thief-of-fate\"> Bard's Tale III</a> was also included.<br/><br/> The game also uses\u00a0 the grid-based, 3D system wherein the world is viewed from a first-person perspective with 90\u00b0 turns and movement spaces similar to the Bard's Tale series with a few cosmetic differences. Within the ever-present interface, on the upper left quadrant of the screen displayed the world with the party listed to the right along with any encounter messages and options. A text box on the bottom quadrant of the screen would display messages such as combat results. Random enemy encounters would provide combat opportunities within the game against mixed groups of foes. Hit and spell points are represented by bars instead of numbers.<br/><br/>Copy protection took the form of a series of paragraphs that served as descriptors for various areas within the game proper. When prompted, the player was asked to read the appropriate paragraph for the required information. This method had also been used in Wasteland.<br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15693/616690-dragon_wars_03_1_.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-616690\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.8\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:80.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15693/616690-dragon_wars_03_1_.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-616690\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15693/616690-dragon_wars_03_1_.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15693/616690-dragon_wars_03_1_.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a></figure>  The game challenged players immediately from the start. After character creation was completed and a party assembled, the player was tested to find a way to survive as they would start the game with nothing in their inventory.<br/><br/>As with most RPGs of this type, party setup and character selection were left entirely up to the player. If the player so chose to create a party of warriors, they could expect extreme difficulty ahead without a mage to help teleport them back home, out of a dungeon, or heal them adequately in combat. A party is limited to seven characters, although the manual suggests leaving one slot open for summoned monsters or special encounters that may join the party.<br/><br/>Characters could be imported from any of the three games in the Bard's Tale series which would give them an advantage in statistics early on.<br/><br/>As noted earlier, it is suggested that players do so in order to survive the initial encounters, or grind the first dungeon until they are able to hold their own in combat. It will only get worse from there. However, there are a variety of exploits that can dramatically level parties up with experience early on in the game.<br/><br/><h3> <u><b>Races</b></u></h3>Dragon Wars did not feature any races within the game to choose from for character creation. Everyone on Oceana was human.<br/><br/>Death was also somewhat permanent and there were no listed spells within the manual that could perform resurrection. <br/><br/><h3> <u><b>Characters<br/></b></u></h3> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8273/1048580-1055269275_00.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1048580\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.626\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.6%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8273/1048580-1055269275_00.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1048580\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8273/1048580-1055269275_00.gif\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8273/1048580-1055269275_00.gif 500w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/8273/1048580-1055269275_00.gif 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8273/1048580-1055269275_00.gif 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8273/1048580-1055269275_00.gif\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8273/1048580-1055269275_00.gif 500w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/8273/1048580-1055269275_00.gif 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8273/1048580-1055269275_00.gif 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure>  Parties consist of seven characters. Players can only create four characters of their own and\u00a0 the last three slots are reserved for NPCs that can be hired into the group as they are encountered in the adventure. Unlike the Bard's Tale or Wasteland, however, there is no Adventurer's Guild or HQ for players to swap out characters or create new ones on the fly. Once a party was created, the only way to create a new character would be to start the game over.<br/><br/>During character creation, the player can determine their name, sex, and then distribute fifty character points to improve their statistics and purchase skills. Statistics in Dragon Wars are not rolled during creation. Every character starts out with a ten in every attribute and further changes are made using the points that they are given.<br/><br/><h3> <u><b>Statistics</b></u></h3>During creation, the player is given the chance to adjust the starting statistics for their character. While playing the game, a character's profile could be viewed by simply hitting an appropriate number key to show a character's abbreviated statistics along with various other pieces of information. The abbreviated value for how these attributes appear onscreen are listed in parenthesis.<br/><br/><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li><strong>Strength (STR):</strong> Ideal for fighters as well as for performing physical tasks. Weapons in the game have a particular strength requirement and anything over that limit translates into additional damage.</li> <li><strong>Intelligence (INT):</strong> As with most RPGs, it's an important attribute for potential spellcasters and for solving puzzles that require a high INT score. It also determines whether a spell will hit its opponent.</li> <li><strong>Dexterity (DEX):</strong> Helps in hitting opponents along with avoiding incoming blows. It also determines who goes first in combat making it essential for fighters.</li> <li><strong>Spirit (SPR):</strong> This is important for spellcasters and determines how many power points magic users have at their disposal.</li> <li><strong>Power (POW):</strong> This represents the current number of points that a spellcaster has at their disposal. These do not regenerate naturally requiring the player to find alternate means of recharging their mages such as using a Dragonstone or other source.</li> <li><strong>Health:</strong> When reduced to zero, the character dies. It can only be restored through the use of magic, finding a healer, or using the bandage skill.</li> <li><strong>Stun:</strong> Characters will typically run out of this first before they run out of health. When reduced to zero, they fall unconscious and are unable to fight but they aren't dead. This regenerates automatically after combat.</li> <li><strong>Sex:</strong> As the manual states, male, female, sometimes, or never.</li> <li><strong>Experience:</strong> This measures how many points must be earned until the next level. Level progression in Dragon Wars is particularly slow making character development and the distribution of points extremely important to consider in the long term.</li> <li><strong>Level:</strong> When a level is earned, a character gains two points with which to spend on attributes or skills.</li> <li><strong>Armor Class (AC):</strong> This more directly shows the quality of your armor versus the chance that an enemy blow has to connect. The better, or higher, this value is, the less damage a character's health or stun levels will receive. </li> <li><strong>Attack Value (AV) &amp; Defense Value (DV):</strong> These are based on a character's dexterity divided by four and are the basic statistics governing combat. These determine how often you hit in combat and how often a character receives the same treatment. Heavier armor may improve your armor class, but it may drive down your defense value because of its weight.</li> </ul> <br/><h3> <u><b>Skills</b></u></h3>These determine how well your characters will survive the game with a variety of fields that can help them. Because of the slow rate of character development and the low number of skill points given to each character when they level, character specialists are increasingly important to consider when building your party. Although Wasteland uses a skill system, the one in Dragon Wars is not dependent on the intelligence level of any particular character. Having the right number of character points is all that is needed. <br/><br/>The skills available to characters are:<br/><br/><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li><strong>Bandage:</strong> This is the healing ability of a character. The greater this skill, the more health is restored.</li> <li><strong>Cave Lore:</strong>\u00a0 May reveal hidden pieces of information during the exploration of underground places.</li> <li><strong>Climb:</strong> This skill is used to climb over rocks, into trees, and down to certain doom. Having a high climb skill is necessary in several places.</li> <li><strong>Forest Lore:</strong> Operates in the same way as Cave Lore by providing certain pieces of information to characters that have this.</li> <li><strong>Hiding:</strong> Useful for hiding from potential enemy encounters. Useless once combat begins.</li> <li><strong>Tracker:</strong> Allows the character to track various creatures by the trail they leave behind.</li> <li><strong>Lockpick:</strong> Allows a characer to get into places where they aren't invited. Extremely useful and the manual suggests that it is an important skill to have in resolving your quest.</li> <li><strong>Magic Skills:</strong> Characters hoping to learn magic must first learn the LOW MAGIC discipline before they can access any of the othres. The higher one's expertise is in a particular discipline, the better of a chance they will have for their spells to hit their target.</li> <li><strong>Mountain Lore:</strong> Similar to Cave and Forest Lore skills, can reveal hidden secrets while traveling amidst the mountains.</li> <li><strong>Fistfighting:</strong> Determines how well a character can fight with their hands.</li> <li><strong>Arcane Lore:</strong> A mage with both magical ability and knowledge is a well rounded character. The skill helps with matters pertaining to magic.</li> <li><strong>Bureaucracy:</strong> This determines how charismatic a character can be in trying to get their way.</li> <li><strong>Swim:</strong> Can help with water hazards but not for swimming in between the islands of Dilmun.</li> <li><strong>Town Lore:</strong> Helps by revealing certain pieces of legend and lore concerning a town the party may be visiting.</li> <li><strong>Pickpocket:</strong> Allows a character to borrow a few coins from unsuspecting NPCs.</li> <li><strong>Weapon Skills:</strong> Weapon use is not determined by having the skill to use it, although investing points into the appropriate category will improve a character's ability to use it.</li> </ul> <br/>As in Wasteland, characters can use any of their skills in order to solve puzzles or on certain NPCs.<br/><br/><h3> <u><b>Magic</b></u></h3> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8273/1048579-1055203268_00.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1048579\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.626\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.6%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8273/1048579-1055203268_00.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1048579\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8273/1048579-1055203268_00.gif\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8273/1048579-1055203268_00.gif 500w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/8273/1048579-1055203268_00.gif 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8273/1048579-1055203268_00.gif 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8273/1048579-1055203268_00.gif\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8273/1048579-1055203268_00.gif 500w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/8273/1048579-1055203268_00.gif 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8273/1048579-1055203268_00.gif 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure>  With the restrictions on magic in the world of Dragon Wars, being a magic user comes at a high price. Namtar, the main antagonist of the story, has become the most powerful sorceror of Dilmun by manipulating King Drake to declare his ban on magic. With no other opposition, Namtar is free to monopolize his power and has already acted. The other city-states took to warfare to defy King Drake's decree, losing their spellcasters in the opening stages of the war. Namtar's Stosstrupen, a sort of magical secret police, had also worked to assassinate Dilmun's top sorcerors before they could organize an effective resistance. It is the player's task to recover this magical knowledge and use it against Namtar before he can move ahead with his plans to conquer what is left.<br/><br/>Learning a spell in Dragon Wars requires finding a scroll with the appropriate knowledge and then using it, causing it to vanish forever. Because most of those that even knew of how to teach magic are dead, in hiding, or worse, discovering any piece of magic is one of the challenges.<br/><br/>Low Magic is initially available as a skill purchase to new characters, but the disciplines of High, Sun, and Druid magic must be learned from their respective masters.<br/><br/>There are four major spell classes:<br/><br/><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li><strong>Low Magic:</strong> Weak, widespread, and of little threat, Namtar has done little to purge this discipline. Purgatory still maintains a working Low Magic shop as a result.</li> <li><strong>High Magic:</strong> The acknowledged master of High Magic was the Stosstrupen's first target. He was turned to stone and then smashed. With his demise, the practice of High Magic had all but ended. High magic has a number of powerful spells for combat, healing, and even summoning purposes but characters will need to find someone who can teach them. It cannot be chosen at the start of the game.</li> <li><strong>Sun Magic:</strong> Oddly enough, Sun Magic remains public and legal and the master of this art lives in Phoebus at the Temple of the Sun. It has the most potent offensive spells in the game. Characters will need to meet with Mystalvision, the master of Sun Magic and a public hero, to learn how to use this discipline. As with High Magic, it cannot be learned during character creation.</li> <li><strong>Druid Magic:</strong> The \"purest\" discipline focused on nature, it has a number of useful utility spells that allow passge through stone walls as well as potent healing. Finding someone who will be able to teach characters is easier said than done. As with High and Sun Magic, Druid magic cannot be chosen at the start of the game.</li> </ul> <br/><h2>Encounters and Combat<br/></h2> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8273/1048575-1055202111_00.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1048575\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.626\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.6%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8273/1048575-1055202111_00.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1048575\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8273/1048575-1055202111_00.gif\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8273/1048575-1055202111_00.gif 500w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/8273/1048575-1055202111_00.gif 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8273/1048575-1055202111_00.gif 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8273/1048575-1055202111_00.gif\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8273/1048575-1055202111_00.gif 500w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/8273/1048575-1055202111_00.gif 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8273/1048575-1055202111_00.gif 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure>  When the party encounters a random enemy, a descriptive list is given at the start. Any group of monsters within 10' (feet) of your party are within melee range. Some monsters, however, will also use ranged attacks. Combat is divided into a series of rounds and it is up to the player to decide what they should do next.<br/><br/>The player's options during such an encounter are are:<br/><br/><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li><strong>Fight: </strong>Initiates combat with the typical options.</li> <li><strong>Quickly Fight:</strong> This initiates combat but with fewer options than <strong>Fight</strong> in order to quickly resolve the encounter.</li> <li><strong>Run:</strong> The party will attempt to flee.</li> <li><strong>Advance Ahead: </strong>Moves the party closer to a ranged encounter to narrow the distance.</li> </ul> <br/>If the Fight option is chosen, melee character will have the option of striking a normal blow (as in Quick Fight), a mighty blow (reduced hitting chance but greater damage), or a disarm which will deal some damage but attempt to knock an enemy's weapon away. Players will also be able to rearrange their party. They will also be able to block when this option is used.<br/><br/>Under both types of fighting options, players will always be able to use an item, run like a coward, dodge an attack, or cast a spell. If players run from combat, the computer will randomly run the party across the map.

events of the first <a data-ref-id=\"3030-22770\" href=\"/bards-tale/3030-22770/\" slug=\"bards-tale\">  Bard's Tale</a>, the party that is presumably the same that had saved the city of Skara Brae receives a desperate letter from a mage called Saradon who implores them to come to his aid. An evil and powerful archmage named Lagoth Zanta and his hordes threaten the cities of the Realm and it is his hope that the player's party will be able to stop him. But the only relic that could unite the cities and give the party the power to stop his invasion has been shattered. The fabled Destiny Wand that has maintained seven centuries of peace is gone and with it, the hopes of an entire land. <br/><br/>However, Saradon has managed to discover where the pieces of the wand lay hidden. Broken into seven pieces and hidden within seven deadly Snares of Death throughout the land, the party is challenged to reforge the Destiny Wand, call upon the powers of the Destiny Knight, and ultimately confront and destroy Lagoth Zanta. <br/><br/>The players begin their quest in Tangramayne, the capital city of the Realm, a land where six other cities lay scattered across a large, open wilderness. From there, they must gather the clues needed to unravel the locations of several other dungeons, each containing a vital clue to lead the party on to their next destination. There are no cinematics within the game to help tell the story, although there are occasionally small events in the form of text that help describe some of the key elements within the game. The Snares of Death, in particular, had \"magic mouths\" which would present their challenges in the form of riddles filled with the clues needed to survive each one. <br/><br/>The hint guide, bearing the title \"Dream Quest\", for the game was particularly noteworthy for its narrative approach in guiding the player. Taking on the form of a fictional story centered around a party of adventurers that sought the services of an old wizard and his young apprentice, they would embark on a \"vision quest\" into the possibilities offered to them of a quest for a certain \"golden fleece\" or that of the Destiny Wand. The young apprentice would invisibly accompany the party into the vision and the journal that he would carry would magically write itself with their experiences and his own thoughts creating the story journal. The hint guide was illustrated with artistic sketches alongside maps and would describe the ending of the game as well as that of its own story.<br/><br/><h2>Overview</h2> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15693/611206-bards_20tale_20ii__20the_20__20the_20destiny_20knight_4_1_.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-611206\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.625\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15693/611206-bards_20tale_20ii__20the_20__20the_20destiny_20knight_4_1_.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-611206\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15693/611206-bards_20tale_20ii__20the_20__20the_20destiny_20knight_4_1_.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15693/611206-bards_20tale_20ii__20the_20__20the_20destiny_20knight_4_1_.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a></figure>  Players must assemble a band of adventurers and track down the seven pieces of the Destiny Wand to confront and defeat the evil Archmage, Lagoth Zanta.

They are:<br/><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>Tangramayne</li> <li>Ephesus</li> <li>Philippi</li> <li>Colosse</li> <li>Corinth</li> <li>Thessalonica</li> </ul> <br/>The game continues to use the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1318\" href=\"/grid-based-movement/3015-1318/\" slug=\"grid-based-movement\">  grid-based</a>, 3D system wherein the world is viewed from a first-person perspective with 90\u00b0 turns and movement spaces. Within the persistent interface, a small window on the upper left quadrant of the screen displayed the world as in the first with the party listed below and a text box in the upper right quadrant of the screen displaying messages and encounter options. Random enemy encounters would provide combat opportunities within the game against mixed groups of foes which would now use ranged attacks.<br/><br/>Destiny Knight was also notable for its use of an open wilderness between the six cities of the Realm, the land in which the story takes place. Predating similar efforts such as that found in Bethesda's <a data-ref-id=\"3025-174\" href=\"/elder-scrolls/3025-174/\" slug=\"elder-scrolls\">  Elder Scrolls series</a> by several years, the wilderness contained several dungeon areas that were necessary to complete for the main quest. <a data-ref-id=\"3015-932\" href=\"/puzzles/3015-932/\" slug=\"puzzles\">  Puzzles</a> were also given a high priority this time around in the form of Death Snares, trap rooms in which the pieces of the Destiny Wand were hidden and which could kill the entire party if they failed to solve it within a certain time limit. A rough map was included with the game showing the locations for several places but leaving the mapping of each interior to the graph paper tablets RPGers at the time used often to keep from getting lost.<br/><br/><h2>Gameplay</h2> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15693/538474-dk_c64_guild_1_.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-538474\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.625\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15693/538474-dk_c64_guild_1_.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-538474\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15693/538474-dk_c64_guild_1_.gif\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15693/538474-dk_c64_guild_1_.gif 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15693/538474-dk_c64_guild_1_.gif\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15693/538474-dk_c64_guild_1_.gif 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure>  Beginners were given a break in the form of a pre-made party that they can use to jump right into the game with. The adventure starts at the Adventurer's Guild, a location in each city where the player can save the game, form their party, and save their characters to disk just in case the worst happens. Across from the initial Guild is a starter dungeon which should get them up to speed on both the game systems as well as toughen their characters up for the trials ahead. The manual suggests that the characters should reach level 14 before venturing anywhere else in the game.<br/><br/>As with most RPGs of this type, party setup and character selection were left entirely up to the player. A party is limited to seven characters, although the manual suggests leaving one slot open for summoned monsters or special encounters that may occasionally join the party. This was particularly important within one of the dungeons of the game as a particular NPC would be required to help solve a puzzle.<br/><br/>Time also plays a factor in the game as it cycles from day to night, night bringing out the more dangerous creatures that roam the Wilderness.<br/><br/>Veterans can transfer character data from the first <a data-ref-id=\"3030-22770\" href=\"/bards-tale/3030-22770/\" slug=\"bards-tale\">  Bard's Tale</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-9180\" href=\"/wizardry-proving-grounds-of-the-mad-overlord/3030-9180/\" slug=\"wizardry-proving-grounds-of-the-mad-overlord\">  Wizardry I</a>, or <a data-ref-id=\"3030-6990\" href=\"/ultima-iii-exodus/3030-6990/\" slug=\"ultima-iii-exodus\">  Ultima III</a> if they want to start off with a solid group of characters, although items and the like are not brought over.<br/><br/>The game did not make use of an outside license for its statistics and rules, although it shared many similarities with TSR's Dungeons and Dragons ruleset with significant differences that set it apart. In particular, mages were not required to maintain a memorized \"pool\" of spells as in D&amp;D and instead cast their spells by using spell points which represented their inner strength and power. The types of spells that any one mage could cast were also dramatically different, although a character's <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1681\" href=\"/attributes/3015-1681/\" slug=\"attributes\">  general statistics</a> would reflect some of the traditional mentality that TSR's influence over RPGs at the time had made an impression with.<br/><br/><h3> <u><b>Races</b></u></h3>Seven races are available for players to choose from and is the first step in creating a new character and a party of seven adventurers with which to go out and save the world.<br/><strong><br/></strong><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li><strong><a data-ref-id=\"3015-810\" href=\"/human/3015-810/\" slug=\"human\">  Human</a>:</strong> As in most RPGs, their statistics and abilities are fairly average across the board with no distinctive bonuses.</li> <li><strong>Elf:</strong> Fair haired, fair skinned, and more agile than humans, their specialities are focused on both magic and war although they tend to do better as spellcasters.</li> <li><strong><a data-ref-id=\"3015-940\" href=\"/dwarves/3015-940/\" slug=\"dwarves\">  Dwarf</a>:</strong> Short, gruff, and strong if not very smart, dwarves excel as solid warriors in the Bard's Tale.</li> <li><strong><a data-ref-id=\"3015-987\" href=\"/hobbits/3015-987/\" slug=\"hobbits\">  Hobbit</a>:</strong> Small, nimble, and wise, they make ideal rogues.</li> <li><strong>Half-Elf:</strong> Thanks to their mixed ancestry, they are able performers as fighters although not as good as spellcasting as their elven peers.</li> <li><strong>Half-Orc:</strong> Part human, all ugly, they also make decent fighters but offer no other significant bonus other than variety to the party.</li> <li><strong><a data-ref-id=\"3015-1447\" href=\"/gnomes/3015-1447/\" slug=\"gnomes\">  Gnome</a>:</strong> Resemble dwarves but are better at using magic.

Using a combination of different skills is the key to building a solid party that will be able to return home and sing of their adventures. On the party screen, characters are represented by their name and abbreviated class for quick reference along with all of the requisite attributes such as <a data-ref-id=\"3015-400\" href=\"/hit-points/3015-400/\" slug=\"hit-points\">  hit point</a>s (HIT PTS) and  Spell Points (SPL PTS) in\u00a0 columns and lines.<br/><br/><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li><strong>Warrior (WA):</strong> The consummate fighter, they can use nearly every weapon that they find. For every four levels of experience after the first, they gain the ability to dish out an extra attack.</li> <li><strong>Paladin (PA):</strong> These are fighters dedicated to smiting evil wherever it may be. They can perform multiple attacks at higher levels, use most any weapon including certain ones that other fighters can't, and have a greater resistance to evil magic. Unlike in other systems, such as Dungeons &amp; Dragons, the player does not have to pick a deity for them to worship nor can they cast any spells of their own at higher levels. They are a pure fighter with bonuses making them a staple of any party in the Bard's Tale.</li> <li><strong> Rogue (RO):</strong> The professional thieves of the Realm, what they lack in fighting ability they make up for being sneaky. They can hide in shadows (thus avoiding damage from enemies) and are able to search for and disarm traps of which there are many especially within the Death Snares.</li> <li><strong>Bard (BA):</strong> They are warriors that have learned to sing. Although they don't have multiple attacks at higher levels as a true warrior class would, their songs are capable of spell-like effects that can aid the party in a variety of ways. Unlike spell casters, the Bard's songs bestow important buffs on the entire party for the duration of the song. Their songs can often work even within anti-magic zones. If combat interrupts a song, it will pick up again when it is completed even if another song is performed during the fight. An instrument is needed for a Bard in addition to whatever weapons they have. The Bard can play as many tunes in his repertoire until his throat dries, thus necessitating a visit to the local tavern for a tankard of fine ale to get them going again.</li> <li><strong>Hunter (HU):</strong> They can use most weapons and have the ability to often instantly kill an opponent by striking a vital nerve center, an ability that improves as they gain experience levels.</li> <li><strong>Monk (MO):</strong> They use traditional fighting weapons and gain more effectiveness at fighting with their bare hands at higher levels becoming devastating warriors.</li> </ul> <br/> Magic users were divided into several classes with a few of these requiring a pre-requisite in ability. Mages had to meet those requirements before graduating to the higher classes which are initially unavailable to a starting party. It was also a one-way class change. Once a character chose to be a particular class, they were locked into that decision and could not learn any spells that they chose not to.<br/><br/><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li><strong>Conjurers (CO)</strong>: One of the first classes that a magic user can start with. They can create fireballs and compasses to help defend and guide the party and have a smattering of healing spells for support.</li> <li><strong>Magicians (MA): </strong>This is another class that new magic users can start off with. They can enchant items with temporary effects and user their spells as buffs to aid the party in combat, such as improving their armor class.</li> <li><strong>Sorcerors (SO): </strong>They can create illusions including illusory party members and aid in the perception of the world around the party with spells enabling them to see in the dark. Most of their offensive spells tend to be mind based. These are not initially available to new characters until they have earned three levels of experience as either a Conjurer or a Magician. In other words, if a Magician character class has leveled far enough to cast third level spells, they can become a Sorceror.</li> <li><strong>Wizard (WI): </strong>As with the Sorceror, a mage must learn at least three spell levels of their starting class before they can become a Wizard. Wizards are the summoning specialists and have the ability to raise the dead making them extremely valuable.</li> <li><strong>Archmage (AR): </strong>This class can only be attained after learning three spell levels from each of the preceding classes, although the manual suggests that a true Archmage is one that has learned all seven from each. Archmages have the smallest number of spells to choose from, but make up for this thanks to the sheer power vested within each one. They are able to heal an entire party, resurrect multiple characters at once, crush enemies with incredible magic, and summon powerful allies. Lagoth Zanta, the main antagonist of the game, is an Archmage.</li> </ul> <br/><h3> <u><b>Locations</b></u></h3> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15693/611209-bards_20tale_20ii__20the_20__20the_20destiny_20knight_6_1_.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-611209\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.625\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15693/611209-bards_20tale_20ii__20the_20__20the_20destiny_20knight_6_1_.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-611209\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15693/611209-bards_20tale_20ii__20the_20__20the_20destiny_20knight_6_1_.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15693/611209-bards_20tale_20ii__20the_20__20the_20destiny_20knight_6_1_.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15693/611209-bards_20tale_20ii__20the_20__20the_20destiny_20knight_6_1_.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15693/611209-bards_20tale_20ii__20the_20__20the_20destiny_20knight_6_1_.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure>  There are a variety of locales in the game that provide a number of important services, listed both in the manual and within the game itself:<br/><br/><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li><strong>The Sage: </strong>He lives out in the Wilderness and is a valuable treasure trove of knowledge. The player must make use of his services in order to ask for the location of certain places to which he will point the way, but only for a price. As the player journeys through the world, they will encounter new clues that they must barter with the Sage on in order to continue the quest, entering certain key words into the parser that comes up when conversing with him.</li> <li><strong>Temples:</strong> Provide valuable healing services for when your mages aren't powerful enough yet to do the healing themselves. They are also the only places tha can cure withered characters (old age) or ones that have been turned to stone. The manual says that the resurrected character may need to sell their soul in order to come back to life, but in terms of the game, that doesn't happen.</li> <li><strong>Roscoe's Energy Emporium:</strong> Roscoe is a mage who had opened a chain of energy emporiums in order to cash in on the sorcereal energy crisis of '27. Even after it had passed, Roscoe's emporiums continue to provide a valuable service by recharging the spell points of wealthy mages. His services don't come cheap, but if you can't wait for spell points to regenerate, his emporiums are worth a visit.</li> <li><strong>Unmarked Buildings:</strong> While exploring the cities of the Realm, the player can barge into unmarked buildings. This also tends to trigger a combat encounter. For the most part, there is nothing to see in any of these structures except the exit, although the party will be running into several of these in searching for hidden dungeon entrances leading to the next part of their quest.</li> <li><strong>Adventurer's Guild:</strong> This is the \"union hall\" where unemployed characters hang around hoping to join the next expedition. This is where it all begins and one is located in each of the major cities. Saves are handled here along with party formation. You can't save while in the middle of a dungeon or out in the wilderness, so knowing where these are located in each city is an important part of the game. You can also remove characters from your party and keep them here in case you need to free up an extra slot for a special character. One or two puzzles require the use of a special character in the party.</li> <li><strong>Garth's Equipment Shoppe:</strong> Garth retired from adventuring and his deeds are sung far and wide. He now sells his knowledge of weapons and artifacts as a part of a string of stores that lie spread across the Realm, providing basic equipment to everyone as well as a few particularly rare and powerful pieces for those with enough gold. He can also identify unknown items thanks to his extensive knowledge, for a price, Selling rare items to Garth will not appear in his shoppe, though, so be careful about getting rid of items that you might need later on. Fortunately, quest items cannot be sold. Garth is everywhere and in every shoppe, so you don't need to worry about trekking back to one particular branch.</li> <li><strong>Review Board:</strong> Shadowy figures representing all of the classes in the game sit in judgement over characters that come to them for advancement. If you have enough experience, you'll get your level. Mages learn their spells in batches, so once they gain a spell level, all spells in that tier are learned. These are not marked on any map and must be discovered. The good news is that they typically have a unique facade so turning and facing a building is all that is needed to know what it is.</li> <li><strong>Casinos:</strong> Players can gamble their ill gotten gold in these halls for the chance to score big, although the dealers have been known to cheat if stiffed for a tip.</li> <li><strong>Bedder's Bank for the Bold:</strong> An old-half elf who had reputedly sold his own mother to a band of lonely orcs to finance his first branch, Bedder will deposit your gold for safekeeping in case anything...tragic...happens to the party. There's no interest and withdrawals must be made for the entire amount, but gold can be added at any time in any amount. Good for making sure that there's a nest egg out there available for any set of characters that you might create. </li> <li><strong>Taverns:</strong> The rest stop for the Bard in your party and a place to hear pieces of gossip.</li> </ul> <br/>There were also the seven major dungeons that could only be found with the help of the Sage scattered throughout the Realm. Each dungeon would consist of several levels and sometimes possessed a <a data-ref-id=\"3015-50\" href=\"/boss-fight/3015-50/\" slug=\"boss-fight\">  boss fight</a> or two in addition to the Death Snare within. They would take the form of tombs, crypts, castles, and even a tower.<br/> <br/><h2>Combat</h2> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15693/595838-gfs_29433_2_1_1_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-595838\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.625\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15693/595838-gfs_29433_2_1_1_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-595838\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15693/595838-gfs_29433_2_1_1_.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15693/595838-gfs_29433_2_1_1_.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15693/595838-gfs_29433_2_1_1_.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15693/595838-gfs_29433_2_1_1_.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure>  Fighting in the game is handled through random encounters and is required to earn those valuable <a data-ref-id=\"3015-39\" href=\"/experience-points/3015-39/\" slug=\"experience-points\">  experience points</a> and grow the party into an unstoppable force capable of facing the dangers ahead. A list of foes (broken down by the number in each group) is given at the start of the fight. The maximum number of foes is up to four groups of monsters. Any group of monsters within 10' (feet) of your party are within melee range. Some monsters, however, will also use ranged attacks such as breath weapons or spells to deal damage, or summon monsters to block your advance. Combat is divided into a series of rounds and it is up to the player to decide what they should do next.<br/><br/>Party arrangement is also important. The first four characters can be physically attacked and can dish out the same leaving the last three to resort to ranged attacks.<br/><br/>Combat actions are triggered by hitting the appropriate key when a character's turn comes up, allowing the player to time certain attacks for when it is a particular character's turn to act in that round. They are:<br/><br/><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li><strong>(A)ttack foes: </strong>Orders a character to physically assault the enemy. This applies to the first four chraacters only.</li> <li><strong>(P)arty attack:</strong> Orders a character to beat down a fellow party member or special character. Sometimes necessary.</li> <li><strong>(D)efend:</strong> This reduces the damage a character may recieve in case you suspect that they can do nothing else at the moment.</li> <li><strong>(U)se an Item:</strong> Allows a character to use a ranged weapon or a magic item.</li> <li><strong>(B)ard Song:</strong> Tells the Bard to play a short tune during the fight. Typically lasts for only one round.</li> <li><strong>(C)ast a Spell:</strong> This is where mages get to work their magic. When selected, the player must enter the four digit code for the spell in question and specify a target if required.</li> <li><strong>(H)ide in Shadows:</strong> Tells a rogue to hide in the shadows, avoiding damage during that turn since the enemy can't see them. They can also avoid spell effects this way.</li> </ul> <br/>All of the results are calculated in the background. Certain statistics, such as dexterity and luck, determine who will strike first in a fight. The character in the first party slot is designated as the leader and the chance of running into danger is heavily determined by the statistics of that leader.", "expected_release_day": 3,

"<h2>Overview</h2><p>Parodius Da!, or simply Parodius, is a side-scrolling shoot 'em up from Konami that plays similarly to their <a href=\"/gradius/3025-261/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-261\">Gradius</a> series. Its full Japanese title is Parodius Da! Shinwa kara Owarai e, or \"It's Parodius! From Myth to Laughter\".</p><p>Following the popularity of their own Gradius franchise, <a href=\"/konami-corporation/3010-87/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-87\">Konami</a> took the basic concepts from those games, but added a healthy dose of weird to the characters, environments, and enemies. Parodius is a side-scrolling shoot 'em up at its heart. Players use their ships to blast wave after wave of enemies, collecting powerups that range from shields to missiles to, in the case of Parodius, heat-seaking octopuses.</p><p>A lot of characters in the game come from various Konami franchises, as well as popular characters in Japanese culture and history. It is a very deliberate send-up of Gradius - with menu options including \"One Player\", \"Two Player\", and \"Lollipop\". But despite its zany tone, it is very much a fully-fledged game in its own right.</p><p>This game is actually the second Parodius in the series: the first was exclusive to the Japanese home computer MSX and was named Parodius: Tako wa Chikyuu o Sukuu (\"Parodius: The Octopus Saves the Earth\").</p><h2>Characters</h2><p>While the only playable character in the Gradius series is the Vic Viper fighter, Parodius' selectable characters offer a bit more variety.</p><h3>Twinbee</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/30183/1468413-twinbee.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1468413\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"220\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 220px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/30183/1468413-twinbee.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1468413\"><img alt=\"Twinbee\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/30183/1468413-twinbee.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/30183/1468413-twinbee.jpg 220w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 220px) 100vw, 220px\" data-width=\"220\"></a><figcaption>Twinbee</figcaption></figure><p>A small blue plane with two big fists on the front, <a href=\"/twinbee/3030-21861/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21861\">Twinbee</a> is the eponymous main character in its own series of games, the second of which was ported to the US and renamed as <a href=\"/stinger/3030-16079/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-16079\">Stinger</a>. In its games, Twinbee's powerups were granted by shooting bells that appear on the screen. The bells also appear in Parodius, supplying the player with a limited set of power-ups that work independently from the standard weapon power-ups gained from blowing up enemy ships. Twinbee's power-ups include rocket fists, which fly across the screen and slowly return to the plane, a forwards and backwards shot, a three-way shot, shadowed out copies of Twinbee that fire and cannot be damaged, and a radial shield that offers a wide area of protection.</p><h3>Vic Viper</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/30183/1468417-vic_viper.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1468417\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.8125\" data-width=\"160\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 160px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:81.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/30183/1468417-vic_viper.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1468417\"><img alt=\"Vic Viper\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/30183/1468417-vic_viper.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/30183/1468417-vic_viper.png 160w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 160px) 100vw, 160px\" data-width=\"160\"></a><figcaption>Vic Viper</figcaption></figure><p>The Vic Viper is just about the only normal thing about Parodius.

September 30, 1992 in North America (the game never saw release in Japan). Contra Force was developed and published by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-87\" href=\"/konami-corporation/3010-87/\" slug=\"konami-corporation\">   Konami</a>, and has absolutely no plot ties to the other Contra games, save for a passing mention of the city that Contra Force takes place in <a data-ref-id=\"3030-3016\" href=\"/contra-iii-the-alien-wars/3030-3016/\" slug=\"contra-iii-the-alien-wars\">  Contra III: The Alien Wars</a>. Contra Force was not originally meant to be a Contra game, but rather a completely unrelated game known as Arc Hound, which was previewed in Japan. Arc Hound was never released.<br/><br/>The plot takes place in Neo City, during present day (1992). In Contra Force, there is an elite counter-terrorism unit known as the Blue Group (or the C-Force). The game begins with the team's leader, Burns, conversing with an informant named Fox, who informs the group that the task force's headquarters is in danger. Upon arriving at the designated meeting place to find Fox, they find him murdered, and are ambushed. Burns and the other members of the group (Beans, Iron, and Smith) must solve the mystery of who is behind this, and eliminate them.<br/><br/><h2>Gameplay   </h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6150/496838-cf_13.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-496838\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.875\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6150/496838-cf_13.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-496838\"><img alt=\"\u00a0Contra Force still retains the franchise's renowned difficulty.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6150/496838-cf_13.gif\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6150/496838-cf_13.gif 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0Contra Force still retains the franchise's renowned difficulty.</figcaption></figure>  Despite having the Contra title, Contra Force departs dramatically from many things found in a traditional Contra game. The game still holds onto the over-head and side-scrolling stages, but each of the four characters has a different weapon combination instead of picking up power-ups during gameplay.

Dana uses his magic wand to strategically create or destroy stone blocks, in search of each level's key and exit door. Various monsters block Dana's progress, which he can avoid, trap with blocks, or fight with fire spells.</p><p>The game was first released in the Arcade and was ported to various systems, including the NES. Both the Arcade and NES versions were added to the Wii's <a href=\"/virtual-console/3015-2925/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2925\">Virtual Console</a>, with the latter version also becoming available for the 3DS's and Wii U's Virtual Console. It was also one of the games selected for the Famicom Disk System <a href=\"/disk-writer-exclusive/3015-7686/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7686\">Disk Writer</a> service in Japan and added to Hamster's <a href=\"/arcade-archives/3025-3081/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-3081\">Arcade Archives</a> collection. The 2005 compilation <a href=\"/tecmo-classic-arcade/3030-328/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-328\">Tecmo Classic Arcade</a> for Xbox also includes the game.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>The level design becomes increasingly devious as it progresses and often makes it possible for the player to trap themselves, making it impossible to finish the level. Other levels require precise timing to reach the key and the level's door, while enemies become more frequent and aggressive. Players start with three lives, but can continue by holding UP and pressing A + B from the \"Game Deviation Value\" screen. Once players move beyond level 40, continues return them there. Finishing the game means completing levels 40 through 50 with only 3 lives, a very challenging feat.</p><h3>Abilities</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/23093/2902096-solomon%27s%20key%20%28u%29%20%5B%21%5D_005.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2902096\" data-ratio=\"0.9375\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:93.8%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/23093/2902096-solomon%27s%20key%20%28u%29%20%5B%21%5D_005.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2902096\"><img alt=\"A typical Solomon's Key level.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/23093/2902096-solomon%27s%20key%20%28u%29%20%5B%21%5D_005.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/23093/2902096-solomon%27s%20key%20%28u%29%20%5B%21%5D_005.png 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"></a><figcaption>A typical Solomon's Key level.</figcaption></figure><p>Players can do three things to help Dana move through each level, search for the key, and avoid danger.</p><ul><li>Create and destroy orange blocks in adjacent spaces, including blocks diagonally above or below.</li><li>Break overhead blocks by jumping into them twice with his head.</li><li>Shoot fireballs at enemies after retrieving red potions that are scattered throughout the levels.</li></ul><p>While movement seems simple at first, the game makes use of its limited mechanics to create ever more difficult puzzles that call for precise jumping and block creation.

It has received many upgraded remakes on various platforms. The series was hugely popular in Japan at the time, but never attracted the same popularity overseas. It was the contest game at Hudson's \"2nd National TDK Famicom Caravan\" in 1986 and remained popular and made frequent appearances at the Caravan while it was still being held; there was even a movie produced by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-1145\" href=\"/toho-company-ltd/3010-1145/\">Toho</a> detailing the battle between the two top competitors, one of them being the famous <a data-ref-id=\"3040-89831\" href=\"/takahashi-meijin/3040-89831/\">Toshiyuki Takahashi</a>.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/44493/1663830-bigstarbrain.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1663830\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.848\" data-width=\"500\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 500px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:84.8%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/44493/1663830-bigstarbrain.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1663830\"><img alt=\"A \"Big Star Brain\".\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/4/44493/1663830-bigstarbrain.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/44493/1663830-bigstarbrain.jpg 500w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/44493/1663830-bigstarbrain.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/4/44493/1663830-bigstarbrain.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>A \"Big Star Brain\".</figcaption></figure><p>The game features 16 stages; at the end of each stage is a boss called a \"Star Brain\" which must be destroyed; if the player cannot destroy a Star Brain within a certain period of time, they are returned to a midway point in the stage and must try again.</p><p>The player ship (called Caesar) has 4 levels of shot power. Level 1 is a basic shot; level 2 allows Caesar to move and shoot faster. Level 3 results in a change in the appearance of Caesar and a \"rear-fire\" ability. Level 4 grants Caesar a barrier which protects from enemy bullets and allows Caesar to shoot rapidly in 5 directions! Caesar also becomes temporarily invincible. The music changes when the player reaches level 3, and remains changed until the player loses this level of power. There are several other variations on this which are triggered by other conditions (I.E., losing the barrier downgrades Caesar to a three way shot) There are also various hidden power-ups throughout the game, often triggered by being able to shoot an object a certain number of times in a second. As another unusual feature, it is possible to hide under some pieces of the terrain: The player cannot be hit while doing this, but they cannot shoot either. This feature, while interesting, can lead to some degree of confusion.</p><h2>ENEMIES</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/44493/1664694-lazarus.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1664694\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.86\" data-width=\"150\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 150px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:86.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/44493/1664694-lazarus.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1664694\"><img alt=\"Lazarus.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" data-width=\"150\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/44493/1664694-lazarus.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/44493/1664694-lazarus.jpg 150w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Lazarus.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/44493/1664694-lazarus.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/44493/1664694-lazarus.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" data-width=\"150\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Lazarus.</figcaption></figure><ul><li><span>Melth: Resembling a red water beetle, these are the first enemy encountered.

Sometimes units can be \"ordered\" out of military bases, but this involves a very limited number of units and is more like queuing up initial units rather than actual choosing of what units would be best. These units can be ground- or air-based, ranging from tanks and fighter jets to special weapons that can be unlocked with research. Special weapons include a freeze ray, or even a \"top secret\" jet that must be assembled from pieces. In later levels, some of the monsters even become allies in the fight against Godzilla and company.</p><p>Combat involves moving units adjacent to enemies and attacking them, which enters the combat screen and uses a kind of random \"slot machine\" luck system. Once an attack is selected, the slot machine of three icons can be engaged by pressing controller buttons - if luck (or really good timing) allows for matching symbols to be selected, then the attack has higher chance of hitting or a greater damage output.</p><p>The same music plays throughout the game, with one track used during the player's turn and another during the monsters' phase.</p><p> </p>", "expected_release_day": 14, "expected_release_month": 2, "expected_release_quarter": null, "expected_release_year": 1992, "guid": "3030-1068", "id": 1068, "image": {"icon_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/1707503-tumblr_lgch8ofuzo1qzurbto1_500.jpg", "medium_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_medium/1707503-tumblr_lgch8ofuzo1qzurbto1_500.jpg", "screen_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/screen_medium/1707503-tumblr_lgch8ofuzo1qzurbto1_500.jpg", "screen_large_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/screen_kubrick/1707503-tumblr_lgch8ofuzo1qzurbto1_500.jpg", "small_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_small/1707503-tumblr_lgch8ofuzo1qzurbto1_500.jpg", "super_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_large/1707503-tumblr_lgch8ofuzo1qzurbto1_500.jpg", "thumb_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_avatar/1707503-tumblr_lgch8ofuzo1qzurbto1_500.jpg", "tiny_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_mini/1707503-tumblr_lgch8ofuzo1qzurbto1_500.jpg", "original_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/1707503-tumblr_lgch8ofuzo1qzurbto1_500.jpg", "image_tags": "All Images,Box Art"}, "image_tags": [{"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-1068/?filter=image_tag%3AAll+Images", "name": "All Images", "total": 13}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-1068/?filter=image_tag%3ABox+Art", "name": "Box Art", "total": 1}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-1068/?filter=image_tag%3ANES+Screenshots", "name": "NES Screenshots", "total": 3}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-1068/?filter=image_tag%3AScreenshots", "name": "Screenshots", "total": 12}], "name": "Godzilla 2: War of the Monsters", "number_of_user_reviews": 0, "original_game_rating": null, "original_release_date": null, "platforms": [{"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-21/", "id": 21, "name": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/nintendo-entertainment-system/3045-21/", "abbreviation": "NES"}], "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/godzilla-2-war-of-the-monsters/3030-1068/"}, {"aliases": null, "api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-1113/", "date_added": "2008-04-01 01:38:23", "date_last_updated": "2016-02-26 06:57:41", "deck": "Classic NES platformer in which the game continuously scrolls to the right.

His prototype of the game was a rolling ball that the player would shoot to make it bounce.

Taoist priest and his two bumbling apprentices attempt to fight off a <a href=\"/jiang-shi/3015-2528/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2528\">jiang shi</a> (or kyonshi, as they're called in Japan) and other undead menaces.</p><p>The game puts the player in control of Kenshi as he fights off vampires in one-on-one fights by entering homes, temples, or other areas infested with the creatures. Successfully defeating the jiang shi reduces it to flames, and the player receives the gratitude of the area's owner, who rewards the player. Normal villagers give the player items, such as sacred scrolls, while temple priests let the player regain Kenshi's health whenever he revisits the temple after liberating it.</p><p> Certain buildings are bring up a text window stating \"DANGER IS IN THE AIR\" whenever the A button is pressed near the entrance on the village map. In these buildings, the player must face and defeat multiple kyonshi, which will earn him or her a red orb. After all three orbs in a village have been collected, the player gains access to the village's boss battle, which, if beaten, moves the player on to the next village.</p><p>There are also training halls in every village that accept the sacred scroll items obtained from villagers as payment for teaching Kenchi extra fighting techniques. Inexplicably, the player must answer a  trivia question before being allowed to train, which run the gamut from how many states there are in the United States to questions about specific aspects of Kyonshi (how they can be captured in Chinese mythology, etc.).</p>", "expected_release_day": 16, "expected_release_month": 9, "expected_release_quarter": null, "expected_release_year": 1988, "guid":

data-left-indent=\"0\">Kabuki: Quantum Fighter is a side-scrolling action and platforming game for the NES from <a href=\"/hal-america-inc/3010-2913/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-2913\">HAL</a> and <a href=\"/human-entertainment-inc/3010-1209/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1209\">Human Entertainment</a><i>.</i> Released in 1990, it followed a string of similar games within the genre and became somewhat of a cult classic with references found in popular culture and other games. For example, there is a scene in <a href=\"/soldier-of-fortune/3030-22547/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-22547\">Soldier of Fortune</a> during which the game can be seen in the background being played by one of the characters.</p><h2>Story</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The game takes place in the 2050s, when a rapidly mutating computer virus has infected the defense software that protects the entire planet. To resolve the problem, <a href=\"/scott-oconnor/3005-18348/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-18348\">Colonel Scott O'Connor</a> is chosen to use the Image Transfer System; an untested technology capable of converting the human mind into binary data and transferring it into a computer.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">However, because the ITS is untested, the effects on the human mind are unknown. When Scott's psyche materializes inside the computer system, he is rendered as a kabuki actor. The player must take control of O'Connor and guide him through six levels of intense combat in order to reach the heart of the system and a final confrontation with the virus itself high above Earth in an orbiting satellite.</p><h2>Weapons</h2><h3>Hair</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">O\u2019Connor\u2019s hair can be whipped towards enemies to inflict damage. It has a very limited range and is the players most basic attack.</p><h3>Chips</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The player can throw computer chips at enemies in a more long range attack. A finite number are available in each level for the player to find.</p><h3>Fusion Gun</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Fires powerful but slow moving missiles towards enemies for a very long range attack. Very limited ammo capacity.</p><h3>Quantum Bomb</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Fires in three directions in front of the player. Very short range but extremely powerful.</p><h3>Dynamite</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Thrown forward in parabolic arc making it difficult to land direct hits. Large splash damage effect and power makes it a deadly weapon if on target.</p><h3>Remote Control Bolo</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Automatically targets enemies and lands multiple hits from a single attack. The most powerful weapon in the game and only obtained during the final level.</p><h2>Enemies</h2><h3>Tanks</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Patrol slowly but accelerate within close proximity to the player. No ranged ability and easy to avoid makes this a common enemy.</p><h3>Robo Roaches</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Slowly crawl along the ground with no ranged ability; however they are very durable and require many hits to be destroyed. Drop chips when killed. Very easy to avoid.</p><h3>Flamethrowers</h3><figure style=\"width: 257px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1927/236102-kabuki_quantum_fighter_nes_screenshot2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-236102\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.87548638132296\" data-width=\"257\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1927/236102-kabuki_quantum_fighter_nes_screenshot2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-236102\"><img alt=\"Squawking Heads\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1927/236102-kabuki_quantum_fighter_nes_screenshot2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1927/236102-kabuki_quantum_fighter_nes_screenshot2.jpg 257w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 257px) 100vw, 257px\" data-width=\"257\"></a><figcaption>Squawking Heads</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Stationary enemies that fire powerful flame bursts in a short range.

Requires precise timing to destroy.</p><h3>Dart Throwers</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Bounces left and right until the player enters their ranged at which point they throw powerful darts. Can be eliminated with a ranged attack before they spot the player.</p><h3>Pit Hounds</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Very fast but possessing no ranged attacks.

The player is advised to avoid these enemies whenever possible and bypass them through careful jumping rather than engage in combat.</p><h3>Boomerangers</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Camouflaged enemies which fire boomerangs when in close proximity to the player.

Along with an improved <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/mega-buster/3055-518/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-518\">Mega Buster</a>, protagonist <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/mega-man/3005-344/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-344\">Mega Man</a> can now collect eight circuit chips to help assemble <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/beat/3005-2361/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2361\">Beat</a>, a robotic <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/bird/3015-3105/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3105\">bird</a> (created by both his creator <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/dr-light/3005-292/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-292\">Dr. Light</a> and his new ally <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/dr-mikhail-sergeyevich-cossack/3005-2335/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2335\">Dr. Cossack</a>) that can automatically attack enemies around him.</p><p>Set in the year <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/year-x/3015-7424/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7424\">20XX</a>, the game takes place months after the events of Mega Man 4 (in which the <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/android/3015-692/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-692\">humanoid robot</a> hero <a href=\"/mega-man/3005-344/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-344\">Mega Man</a> defeats the evil roboticist <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/dr-wily/3005-291/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-291\">Dr. Wily</a> a fourth time). <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/proto-man/3005-1559/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1559\">Proto Man</a>, brother and ally to Mega Man, goes rogue and creates <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/robot-masters/3015-154/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-154\">an army of robots</a> to set out destructive attacks all over the world. When Proto Man kidnaps Dr. Light, Mega Man (now with upgrades by his new ally, Dr. Cossack) sets out to rescue him and deliver justice to Proto Man's army.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Following in Mega Man tradition, Mega Man 5 challenges the player with defeating eight robot masters who can be taken down in any order. Defeating a robot master gives Mega Man that master's power. Each robot master has a distinct weakness to one of the other master's power, leaving the player to deduce the optimal order in which to tackle the stages.</p><p>Mega Man 5 is the second game in the series to feature the chargeable Mega Buster. A fully-charged blast covers a larger vertical swath than in Mega Man 4, taking on a larger, rounder, \"<a href=\"/hadouken/3015-668/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-668\">hadoken</a>\"-like shape as opposed to its previous comet-like shape. However, if Mega Man is hit while charging, he loses whatever charge he had built up, requiring the player to re-start the charge from nothing. This is a change from the previous game and other charge weapons (such as the Atomic Heat from <a href=\"/mega-man-2/3030-14026/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14026\">Mega Man 2</a> and Pharaoh Shot from Mega Man 4), where Mega Man can hold the full charge of the weapon no matter when or how often he is hit. Thus, Mega Man 5 requires the player to be much more careful about dodging attacks if s/he is looking to let a full blast loose.</p><p><a href=\"/rush/3005-1318/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1318\">Rush</a>, Dr. Light's robotic dog helper, returns from <a href=\"/mega-man-3/3030-4518/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-4518\">Mega Man 3</a> and 4 in order to assist Mega Man's progress through the game. Similar to Mega Man 4, the Rush Jet cannot be completely controlled; it propels forward in the same direction and the player can only guide it up or down. The Rush Coil behaves differently from past games. Whereas in the past Rush would offer a spring-board off of which Mega Man could jump, in Mega Man 5, the Rush Coil itself becomes a platform, propelling itself upwards once Mega Man jumps aboard. Mega Man can then leap off of it at any time.</p><p>Fliptop / <a href=\"/eddie/3005-12032/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-12032\">Eddie</a> also returns to offer Mega Man an array of powerups, from life and weapon replenishments to 1ups and E-tanks.</p><p>The M-tank makes an appearance in Mega Man 5; whereas consuming an E-tank replenishes all of Mega Man's health, the M-tank replenishes health as well as all weapon energy.</p><p>Each stage has an optional letter to collect; together, the letters spell M-E-G-A-M-A-N-V. These are the aforementioned circuit chips that result in Beat's assembly. As the letters are often placed in precarious spots, it's possible for the player to miss them. Mega Man 5 allows the player to re-enter the stage of any robot master that has already been defeated so that the player can try again to collect the letter. When summoned, Beat accompanies Mega Man and flies around to defeat visible enemies on screen. Beat is only available for as long as the weapon energy allows and is ineffective in some boss encounters.</p><h2>Bosses</h2><h3><a href=\"/gravity-man/3005-1391/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1391\">Gravity Man</a></h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2598/243949-gravity_man_profile.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-243949\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.79012345679012\" data-width=\"162\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 162px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:79.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2598/243949-gravity_man_profile.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-243949\"><img alt=\"Gravity Man\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2598/243949-gravity_man_profile.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2598/243949-gravity_man_profile.png 162w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 162px) 100vw, 162px\" data-width=\"162\"></a><figcaption>Gravity Man</figcaption></figure><ul><li><b>Weapon:</b> Gravity Hold</li><li><b>Weakness:</b> Star Crash</li></ul><p>Gravity Man's level features points that shift the gravity, causing Mega Man to run along the ceiling and jump towards the floor.

It also features a segment where Mega Man must hop between rising bubbles of varying sizes--the smaller ones will eventually pop under his weight, while larger ones will hold, forcing the player to time jumps correctly in order to ascend unscathed. Additionally, there's an auto-scrolling motoarboat section; during it, Mega Man pilots a watercraft along the surface of the water, always facing forward but having to deal with enemies in front of him, behind him, and jumping at him. He cannot use his charge beam nor change weapons (and thus the player can't even get to the pause screen to use an E tank). Contrary to what one might expect, Wave Man does not actually feature sections where Mega Man is submerged in water.</p><h3><a href=\"/stone-man/3005-1505/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1505\">Stone Man</a></h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2598/243961-stone_man_profile.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-243961\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.79012345679012\" data-width=\"162\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 162px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:79.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2598/243961-stone_man_profile.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-243961\"><img alt=\"Stone Man\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 162px) 100vw, 162px\" data-width=\"162\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2598/243961-stone_man_profile.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2598/243961-stone_man_profile.png 162w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Stone Man\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2598/243961-stone_man_profile.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2598/243961-stone_man_profile.png 162w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 162px) 100vw, 162px\" data-width=\"162\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Stone Man</figcaption></figure><ul><li><b>Weapon:</b> Power Stone</li><li><b>Weakness:</b> Napalm Bomb</li></ul><p>Stone Man's level is a quarry-themed environment similar to what Mega Man navigated to defeat <a href=\"/guts-man/3005-886/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-886\">Guts Man</a>, <a href=\"/hard-man/3005-1396/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1396\">Hard Man</a>, and <a href=\"/drill-man/3005-1536/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1536\">Drill Man</a>.

He's probably been in a bit of trouble with his parents, but he can talk to Fred--his pet frog--when he's feeling down. Things are pretty normal for Jason. That is, until one fateful day.</p><p>One day his pet frog decides to go hopping off somewhere, and Jason goes chasing after him. He falls into a giant hole which leads to an underground cavern. To his surprise, he's still all right -- but his pet frog, has mutated due to <a href=\"/radiation/3015-728/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-728\">radiation</a>! Jason eventually stumbles upon a sweet-looking battle-tank, which he claims as his own. The tank is referred to as SOPHIA, which is short for \"Subatomic Omni-directional Probative Hyper-responsive Indomitable Abdicator.\" It's up to the player to guide him with the aid of his new tank through eight stages of underground madness.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/431/291242-blastermas_38.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-291242\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 256px\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/431/291242-blastermas_38.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-291242\"><img alt=\"The master of blasting.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/431/291242-blastermas_38.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/431/291242-blastermas_38.jpg 256w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The master of blasting.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/431/291242-blastermas_38.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/431/291242-blastermas_38.jpg 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The master of blasting.</figcaption></figure><p>As he explores this new world, he will have to defeat a <a href=\"/bosses/3015-229/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-229\">boss</a> for each area.

It is played from a top down isometric perspective and features alot of tweaks to standard racing gameplay.\u00a0 <br/><br/>Tracks have hazards like puddles of water/ rainclouds (that will slow you down), puddles of oil (that will spin you out) or planes that fly over the track at certain points and drop bombs on the contestants.\u00a0To add to the overall pace there are speedstrips that gives you a short burst in speed (and that can be linked together if hit in succession) and often alot of jumps that needs to be taken together with the speedstrips.\u00a0 <br/><br/>Before starting a race you can equip your car with extra nitro for more boosts when you need to get an edge on the competition or weaponry to take them down when you need it the most.\u00a0 <br/><br/>Between races there are also button mashing minigames where you have to win a tug of war versus a monster truck.\u00a0<br/>Cars comes in 4 colors and the CPU will fill up the 2 remaining slots when playing multiplayer.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br/><br/>The game is comparable to <a data-ref-id=\"3030-2140\" href=\"/micro-machines/3030-2140/\" slug=\"micro-machines\">    Micro-Machines</a> or <a data-ref-id=\"3025-507\" href=\"/mario-kart/3025-507/\" slug=\"mario-kart\">   Mario Kart</a><br/><h2>Upgrades and power-up's<br/></h2>There are also stuff laying about on the track that can aid you in your race. There are nitro canisters of the same kind that can be bought before the race that gives you the same effect. Sometimes they are color coded after the colors of the cars so you can only grab the one that corresponds to your own color.<br/>There are also permanent upgrades to your car to pick up. They can give you one of three effects. <br/><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>Turbo\u00a0 - Increases you acceleration.</li><li>Top Speed - Increases your top speed.</li></ul><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>Sticky Tires - Increases your ability to turn, making you able to take corners better</li></ul>These upgrades stack between races and helps you get the edge in races ahead. There are also letters scattered around the tracks that spells the word \"RC Pro Am II\" that will upgrade your car when you have collected them all. <br/>Cash \"power-ups\" gives you money to spend in the store.", "expected_release_day": null, "expected_release_month": null, "expected_release_quarter": null, "expected_release_year": 1992, "guid": "3030-1316", "id": 1316, "image": {"icon_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/2362149-nes_rcproam2_4.jpg", "medium_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_medium/2362149-nes_rcproam2_4.jpg", "screen_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/screen_medium/2362149-nes_rcproam2_4.jpg", "screen_large_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/screen_kubrick/2362149-nes_rcproam2_4.jpg", "small_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_small/2362149-nes_rcproam2_4.jpg", "super_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_large/2362149-nes_rcproam2_4.jpg", "thumb_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_avatar/2362149-nes_rcproam2_4.jpg", "tiny_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_mini/2362149-nes_rcproam2_4.jpg", "original_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/2362149-nes_rcproam2_4.jpg", "image_tags": "All Images,Box Art"}, "image_tags": [{"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-1316/?filter=image_tag%3AAll+Images", "name": "All Images", "total": 5}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-1316/?filter=image_tag%3ABox+Art", "name": "Box Art", "total": 2}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-1316/?filter=image_tag%3ANES+Screenshots", "name": "NES Screenshots", "total": 3}], "name": "R.C.

It was very similar to the Gameboy version also released under the same name and takes part in an isometric view of the world. This version of the game had a much more distinct cartoon version of the movie in terms of art direction as opposed to the Activision's version which tried to create more realistic sprites.<br /><br /><h2>Story</h2>The game's story is loosely based on the Ghostbusters II movie and as such the game did not try to explain what the events in the game were and why they were happening. The basic premise of the game was that the once barbarian lord Vigo is trying to resurrect himself. He attempts to do this by stealing a human child through which he can be reborn. This baby is the child of Dana, a person who the Ghostbusters are very close to and now it is up to them to stop him and save Dana's baby.<br /><br /><h2>Gameplay</h2> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17663/586750-select_character.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-586750\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.8\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:80.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17663/586750-select_character.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-586750\"><img alt=\"Character select screen\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/17663/586750-select_character.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17663/586750-select_character.jpg 1280w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/17663/586750-select_character.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/17663/586750-select_character.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\"></a><figcaption>Character select screen</figcaption></figure>At the start of the game the player is able to choose two members of the Ghostbusters team made up of Peter, Egon, Ray, Winston and for some odd reason their accountant Louis. The first character chosen is the primary character and the second character is the trapper. The player has direct control of the primary character and is used to fire a proton beam that momentarily stuns an enemy. The trapper character is utilized to trap the ghosts, thus dispatching of them entirely. The player does not have direct control over the trapper character other than letting them know when to set the trap. The trapper character moves by itself and is invincible. Progress through the game usually meant walking around the different areas of a level and catching all the ghosts before entering a boss battle.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17663/586743-1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-586743\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.8\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:80.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17663/586743-1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-586743\"><img alt=\"Spot em\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/17663/586743-1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17663/586743-1.jpg 1280w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/17663/586743-1.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/17663/586743-1.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Spot em\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/17663/586743-1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17663/586743-1.jpg 1280w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/17663/586743-1.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/17663/586743-1.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Spot em</figcaption></figure><br /><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17663/586754-2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-586754\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.8\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:80.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17663/586754-2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-586754\"><img alt=\"Zap em\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/17663/586754-2.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17663/586754-2.jpg 1280w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/17663/586754-2.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/17663/586754-2.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Zap em\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/17663/586754-2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17663/586754-2.jpg 1280w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/17663/586754-2.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/17663/586754-2.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Zap em</figcaption></figure><br /><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17663/586746-3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-586746\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.8\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:80.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17663/586746-3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-586746\"><img alt=\"Trap em\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/17663/586746-3.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17663/586746-3.jpg 1280w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/17663/586746-3.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/17663/586746-3.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Trap em\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/17663/586746-3.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17663/586746-3.jpg 1280w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/17663/586746-3.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/17663/586746-3.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Trap em</figcaption></figure>\u00a0<br />\u00a0<br />\u00a0<br />\u00a0<br />\u00a0<br />\u00a0<br />\u00a0<br />\u00a0<br />\u00a0<br />\u00a0<br />\u00a0<br /><h2>Game Boy Version\u00a0</h2>Ghostbusters II for the Game Boy was only released in Japan and PAL regions.

It is a sequel to Hudson's earlier hit Bomberman.", "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Robowarrior (Bomber King in Japan) is an action game released for the NES in 1987 in Japan and later published by Jaleco for the US in 1988 with some minor changes. It is a side-scrolling, top-down action game that requires that the player clear out large areas by placing bombs and removing obstacles. Players take control of a Z-type Earth Defense android as he tries to defeat the alien emperor Xur. The player has two main attacks, a rifle that shot short range bullets, and bombs.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Robowarrior features two different types of levels, both of them requiring the player to perform a specific action in order to move on. The first kind of level is a traditional point A to point B layout with a key somewhere on the last screen that needs to be found to move on. The other kind of level is an infinite loop that the player would continue to cycle through until they found the chalice, and then the exit would appear at the end.</p><p>A to B stages are arguably easier as there is a set ending, but the key can be hidden anywhere, including areas of the stage that aren't traditionally destructible like walls. The player is required to bomb everything and anything on the screen in the hope of finding the key. When trying to blow up a part of the environment that wouldn't typically blow up, multiple bombs are needed. The player has a limited number of bombs to accomplish the task. Once out, enemies have to be shot in order to pick up more, one at a time.</p><p>Many stages feature water, which slows the Robowarrior and causes him to slowly sink to the bottom. After a few seconds he will sink completely, which costs a life. In early stages, water can be avoided easily, but later stages are almost entirely water. The player can use life preservers to stay afloat during these levels, but if they take too long their supply will run out and they will drown.</p><p>Enemies re-spawn constantly in every level, giving the player a much needed, although extremely inconvenient source of bombs. Enemies have many advantages over the player. While many of them die with only one hit, most enemies are faster than the player, many can hover over the environments, and others can shoot over them as well. While the player's bullets stop at every wall, the enemy's can travel over every barrier across the entire screen.</p><p>Dispersed throughout the levels are bosses that the player has to defeat. These bosses don't follow any of gameplay involved in the stages and have no tiles in need of bombing. They are more traditional dodge and shoot affairs and like all the other enemies tend to be much stronger and faster than the player.</p><p>Adding to the games extreme difficulty are two additional factors: First, the player's health doubles as power for the Robowarrior, meaning that it depletes constantly over time. Take too long and it will run out, which means losing a life. If the player dies, they may continue on the stage that they died on, but they lose half of their items and half the range of their gun.</p><h2>Weapons/Items</h2><p>Throughout the game, the player can pick up or purchase additional items to assist their mission. These items require the player to open the menu and select them before their effects can be appreciated. Each of these is a one-use item that the player can stockpile and use when they see fit.

In the game the player is not driving cars, but rather controlling radio-controlled vehicles. The game is played from an <a href=\"/isometric-viewpoint/3015-246/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-246\">isometric perspective</a>, giving the game a pseudo 3D look. The player can only see a small section of the track around them.

The player can also use weapons to temporarily disable the other cars so that the player can pass them. R.C.

The game has no real storyline, instead giving the player free reign in the world to do whatever they wish, because pirates don't take orders well. The only caveat is that the player has a limited period of time with which to carry out their swashbuckling, as once a player's character is too old, they are forced into retirement and given an end game summary of how the pirate lived afterwards. The quality of retirement is based on personal fortune, rank, lands owned, reputation, wife, and other events befalling the player. The game contains a career mode, and six shorter scenarios based on real life pirate adventures. </p><p>Throughout the game, players can expect to engage in naval combat, play at sword fighting, visit governors and their daughters, sack and plunder colonies, find buried treasure and lost settlements, and maybe even become victim to a mutiny by their own crew.</p><h3>Fencing and Swordplay </h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9408/750168-1220380768_02.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-750168\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.625\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9408/750168-1220380768_02.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-750168\"><img alt=\" Fighting on a Ship.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9408/750168-1220380768_02.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9408/750168-1220380768_02.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption> Fighting on a Ship.</figcaption></figure><p>Pirates often fought with nothing but cold steel, and this game is no exception. <a href=\"/sword/3055-1/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1\">Sword </a>fighting is depicted by a simple fighting game with basic directional light and heavy attacks and parries. The player must also choose a sword (Rapier, Cutlass or Longsword), which affects their range and damage in combat. </p><p>Most sword fights are accompanied with a background fight between the player's crew and the enemy. This adds the element of time to combat, as when one side's crew has been whittled down to zero, the fight is over. Crew fights are determined by unseen dice rolls, and are influenced by the size of the crew, crew morale and an attack mode (ranging from wild to panic) that the player can adjust.</p><h3>Sailing and Naval Combat </h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9408/750166-1220380768_00.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-750166\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.625\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9408/750166-1220380768_00.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-750166\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9408/750166-1220380768_00.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9408/750166-1220380768_00.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9408/750166-1220380768_00.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9408/750166-1220380768_00.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Players have direct control over the <a href=\"/sailing/3015-1507/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1507\">sailing</a> of their ship, and must possess a degree of navigational knowledge if they are to make their way from Tortuga to Campeche without ending up at Panama by mistake. Captains must be aware of the speed and direction of the winds, which are dependent on the time of year and reflect actual weather conditions in the Caribbean. Other things to consider are storms, shoals and reefs, and of course other ships. </p><p>When another ship is encountered, it must first be identified by the flag that it flies, and players are then given the option to engage it in combat.</p><p><a href=\"/naval-battles/3015-598/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-598\"> Naval combat </a>is basically the same as normal sailing, except with the addition of lethal broadsides fired from the ship's cannons. Player's can choose to sink ships outright, or just grapple and board them with a view to capturing the ship and its cargo.</p><h3>Trade</h3><p>Most Pirates did not just acquire all their wealth and bury it in the sand on some island in the Caribbean. Most plunder was sold to merchants, or taken home to King and Country. This game provides the player with the first option. Alternatively, if one is so inclined, the player can simply buy trade goods and sell them at a different port. This leads to a life of a merchant, who routinely become victims of pirates, turning the game on its head. </p><h3>Sacking Towns</h3><p>If a player was feeling particularly adventurous they have the option of directly attacking ports in order to obtain large amounts of plunder. The attack is presented in the form of a <a href=\"/tactical-turn-based-combat/3015-234/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-234\">turn-based strategy game</a>, including different unit types and terrain which affects unit bonuses to attack and defend. </p><h3>Crew</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9408/750160-1220380766_01.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-750160\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.625\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9408/750160-1220380766_01.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-750160\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9408/750160-1220380766_01.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9408/750160-1220380766_01.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9408/750160-1220380766_01.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9408/750160-1220380766_01.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>A good ship is useless without a crew to man it, so captains need to recruit crew from taverns in ports. The amount of recruiting power a player has is based on his reputation for earning plunder. As most pirate crews are nothing but a pack of scurvy dogs, they do not stay with the player for long. Crew morale is lessened over time, and only more plunder extends the voyage. Eventually the player must divide up his wealth amongst the crew and disband them. If this is not done in a timely fashion, crew members will desert, and eventually mutiny. Most players will go through several crew over the course of their adventures. </p><h3>Colonial Politics</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9408/750129-1151965557_03.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-750129\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.625\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9408/750129-1151965557_03.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-750129\"><img alt=\" A wedding between the player character and the Governor's daughter.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9408/750129-1151965557_03.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9408/750129-1151965557_03.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\" A wedding between the player character and the Governor's daughter.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9408/750129-1151965557_03.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9408/750129-1151965557_03.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption> A wedding between the player character and the Governor's daughter.</figcaption></figure><p>Pirates were often allied with one or more of the major colonial powers in the Caribbean, sinking the ships of their enemies for personal gain. Players can converse with town governors to curry favor, however if a governor hates their guts, the player cannot enter the port and is greeted with cannon fire from the town's defenses. Those players who are in a governor's favor may find themselves bestowed with rank and lands, and maybe even get to meet the governor's daughter. If a player chooses to ally himself with a particular country, they must be heedful of who they are at war with, as peace treaties and alliances change over the course of the game. Those who choose to go it alone will end up at war with all the major powers, and only a pirate amnesty can break this situation.</p><h2>Career Mode </h2><p>Before beginning a new career on the high seas, the aspiring pirate captain is presented with a series of choices which will ultimately affect how the game world is set up and reacts to the player. </p><h3>Time Period </h3><p>There are six different time periods to play in, each with their own set of challenges: </p><ul><li><i>The Silver Empire (1560)</i> - The Spanish Empire is at the height of its power, meaning that all the major ports and trade are controlled by Spain. The Spanish military presence is very strong, making life hard for humble pirates. </li><li><i>Merchants and Smugglers (1600)</i> - Similar to the Silver Empire, but with a few non-Spanish colonies scattered around the Caribbean, and a thriving Dutch smuggling trade has come into existence. </li><li><i>The New Colonists (1620)</i> - The first successful colonies are founded by the enemies of Spain, improving piratical opportunities. </li><li><i>War for Profit (1640)</i> - The Spanish Empire has reached its lowest point, making life ideal for small, independent buccaneers with visions of lots of plunder </li><li><i>The Buccaneer Heroes (1660)</i> - The peak of swashbuckling adventure in the Caribbean </li><li><i>Pirates' Sunset (1680)</i> - The last era of pirate adventuring in the Caribbean. Navy warships patrol the waters, and governors are less tolerant of privateer activities.</li></ul><h3>Nationality </h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9408/750185-1151965557_06.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-750185\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.625\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9408/750185-1151965557_06.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-750185\"><img alt=\" Alignment comes with Responsibilities.

he infiltrates an enemy space fortress, blasting his way from Section-A straight through to the titular Section-Z.", "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Section-Z is a Capcom shoot 'em up. It was one of the first shoot 'em up games to feature a humanoid sprite rather than a spaceship or some other battle vehicle. The protagonist, identified as Captain Commando in some versions of the game, passes through various sections on his way to fight L Brain at the end of the enemy space station. In the Arcade mode, the gameplay switches from horizontal to vertical scrolling stages.</p><p>It was first released for the Arcade in 1985 and later made its way to the NES and Famicom Disk System in 1987. The FDS version was not sold as a retail cart: rather, the player would have to write it onto a blank Famicom disk as part of a Disk Writer service in Japan. The Arcade game was later added to the 2005 <a href=\"/capcom-classics-collection/3030-2138/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2138\">Capcom Classics Collection Vol. 1</a> compilation for PlayStation 2 and the original XBox.</p><h2>Story</h2><p>An enemy space fortress of the Balangool Empire is approaching Earth. Captain Commando has to infiltrate it and find his way to Section-Z to destroy L-Brain, the computer controlling the fortress.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Secton-Z is a side-scrolling game in which the player is a space soldier who can land on the ground and other platform structures and run along them. It is one of the first games which gives players the ability to not only shoot forward, but backwards. It is also one of the first games to give players a choice of paths at the end of each level. Depending on which path they took, they could get special weapons or bombs which wouldn't show up if the other path was taken. To compensate for this, the path without the weapon is often easier. They can activate these special weapons by pressing Select.</p><p>Sometimes, one of the paths will be flashing red instead of the usual yellow. This indicates that it is impassable unless the player locates and destroys the Generator Boss that is creating the field. Therefore, it is imperative to find the right paths through the fortress to get to the Generator and blow it up. Once this is done, it is possible to safely pass through the red gates and move onto the rest of the area, and eventually, the area boss. Each time a generator is destroyed the player will earn a capsule that increases total HP.</p>", "expected_release_day": null, "expected_release_month": null, "expected_release_quarter": null, "expected_release_year": null, "guid": "3030-1432", "id": 1432, "image": {"icon_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/2362190-nes_sectionz_2.jpg", "medium_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_medium/2362190-nes_sectionz_2.jpg", "screen_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/screen_medium/2362190-nes_sectionz_2.jpg", "screen_large_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/screen_kubrick/2362190-nes_sectionz_2.jpg", "small_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_small/2362190-nes_sectionz_2.jpg", "super_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_large/2362190-nes_sectionz_2.jpg", "thumb_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_avatar/2362190-nes_sectionz_2.jpg", "tiny_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_mini/2362190-nes_sectionz_2.jpg", "original_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/2362190-nes_sectionz_2.jpg", "image_tags": "All Images,Box Art"}, "image_tags": [{"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-1432/?filter=image_tag%3AAll+Images", "name": "All Images", "total": 22}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-1432/?filter=image_tag%3ABox+Art", "name": "Box Art", "total": 7}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-1432/?filter=image_tag%3AFDS+Screenshots", "name": "FDS Screenshots", "total": 1}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-1432/?filter=image_tag%3ANES+Screenshots", "name": "NES Screenshots", "total": 12}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-1432/?filter=image_tag%3AScreenshots", "name": "Screenshots", "total": 13}], "name": "Section-Z", "number_of_user_reviews": 0, "original_game_rating": null, "original_release_date": "1985-12-31 00:00:00", "platforms": [{"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-21/", "id": 21, "name": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/nintendo-entertainment-system/3045-21/", "abbreviation": "NES"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-84/", "id": 84, "name": "Arcade", "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/arcade/3045-84/", "abbreviation": "ARC"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-91/", "id": 91, "name": "Famicom Disk System", "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/famicom-disk-system/3045-91/", "abbreviation": "FDS"}], "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/section-z/3030-1432/"}, {"aliases": null, "api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-1446/", "date_added": "2008-04-01 01:39:18", "date_last_updated": "2017-12-12 01:14:45", "deck": "Guide hordes of helpless green-haired rodents away from peril in this landmark puzzle game.", "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-1710556\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/81005/1710556-amigashot17.png\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/81005/1710556-amigashot17.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1710556\"><img alt=\"The first level - 'Just Dig'.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/81005/1710556-amigashot17.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/81005/1710556-amigashot17.png 640w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/81005/1710556-amigashot17.png 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/8/81005/1710556-amigashot17.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>The first level - 'Just Dig'.</figcaption></figure><p>Originally an Amiga exclusive, developed by DMA design (later becoming <a href=\"/rockstar-north/3010-1408/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1408\">Rockstar North</a>) was met with an exceptional reception and was quickly ported to many different platforms. A puzzle game that requires players to direct a group of green haired, blue-shirted, lemmings from point A to point B. The game is based on the myth that lemmings migrate in large groups and follow a single leader, who would often lead them off a cliff to their demise. In the game, lemmings constantly march in one direction unless they run into an obstacle, at which point they turn around and walk the other way. Being fearless and unaware of their own mortality, the lemmings will blindly run into fire, jump off cliffs, become crushed and fall victim to numerous other pitfalls.</p><p>The player must command the lemmings to do certain tasks in order to complete each stage and get a certain percentage of lemmings to safety. These actions include digging, using a pick axe to dig diagonally, using their arms (windmill style) to punch horizontally through terrain and building staircases to traverse large gaps.</p><h2>Levels</h2><p>All levels in Lemmings consist of at least one entrance, and at least one exit. The aim in each level is to safely get an allocated amount of lemmings towards an exit. Obstacles; such as water, deadly traps and great heights will hinder the lemmings' progress.</p><p>There are 120 levels in total, split into four difficulty ratings - Fun, Tricky, Taxing, and Mayhem.</p><h2>Skills</h2><p>There are eight different skills available for the lemmings to carry out. Each level has a different selection and amount of abilities available. Different situations require the use of different skills.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/81005/1712693-vgalemmi_087.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1712693\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/81005/1712693-vgalemmi_087.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1712693\"><img alt=\"Several lemmings using the 'floater' skill.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/81005/1712693-vgalemmi_087.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/81005/1712693-vgalemmi_087.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Several lemmings using the 'floater' skill.</figcaption></figure><p>The skills are:</p><ul><li><b>Climbers</b> - Climbers will climb a vertical surface until they reach the end of the surface.</li><li><b>Diggers</b> - Diggers will dig downward vertically through any soft surface until they reach empty space impenetrable surface.</li><li><b>Miners</b> - These will dig diagonally downward through any soft surface until they reach empty space impenetrable surface.</li><li><b>Bashers</b> - Will dig horizontally through a wall made of any soft surface until they reach empty space impenetrable surface.</li><li><b>Builders</b> - Will build a 12 step stairway diagonally upwards.</li><li><b>Blockers</b> - Will stop walking and block the advances of other lemmings, causing them to reverse their course.</li><li><b>Bombers</b> - A countdown will appear above their head, counting from 5 to 0.

When the energy reserves reaches 0, the game ends.

It is one of the first games of its genre, and contributed many things to that genre, including the concept of bosses. The game is known for having one continuous level, featuring forests, bases, temples, and waterways. Xevious was a huge cult hit in Japan, despite its limited popularity in the United States. The game was also considered to be the first Arcade game to have a television commercial aired for it in the United States.</p><p>The player controls a Solvalou, a combat aircraft containing both a front-firing \"shooter\" for anti-air combat and a \"bomber\" for air-to-ground bombing runs. The game contains both enemy aircraft and enemy ground units, such as tanks and turrets. It is one of the first shoot-em-ups to include hidden bonuses, which could be uncovered by bombing particular areas in the game (these include the SOL towers, which takes one bomb to reveal and one to destroy, and special flags). It is also one of the first shoot-em-ups to include a boss, the massive flying fortress Andor Genesis.</p><p>The game was also known for its glitches and Easter eggs. It's possible to see a short message showing the programmer's name by moving to the bottom-right of the screen, holding down the bomb button and destroying the first two enemies. Another rare Arcade glitch gave the player countless amounts of lives.</p><p>Xevious was ported to many systems, including the <a href=\"/nes/3045-21/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-21\">NES</a>, <a href=\"/atari-8-bit/3045-24/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-24\">Atari 8-bit</a>, <a href=\"/atari-7800/3045-70/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-70\">Atari 7800</a>, <a href=\"/nec-pc-8801/3045-109/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-109\">NEC PC-8801</a>, <a href=\"/nec-pc-9801/3045-112/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-112\">NEC PC-9801</a>, <a href=\"/msx/3045-15/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-15\">MSX</a>, <a href=\"/fm-7/3045-114/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-114\">FM-7</a>, <a href=\"/zx-spectrum/3045-16/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-16\">ZX Spectrum</a>, <a href=\"/commodore-64/3045-14/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-14\">Commodore 64</a>, <a href=\"/atari-st/3045-13/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-13\">Atari ST</a>, <a href=\"/apple-ii/3045-12/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-12\">Apple II</a>, <a href=\"/amstrad-cpc/3045-11/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-11\">Amstrad CPC</a>, <a href=\"/sharp-x1/3045-113/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-113\">Sharp X1</a>, and the <a href=\"/sharp-x68000/3045-95/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-95\">Sharp X68000</a>.

A port of an arcade game, Adventure Island retains the eight stages found in this game.

While enemies and some obstacles kill him in one hit, it is necessary to collect a variety of food items, which restore Master Higgins's life. Additionally, there are some power ups which grant Master Higgins temporary invincibility from enemies and obstacles.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/110964/2344226-hudson_s_adventure_island__usa_.005.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2344226\" data-ratio=\"0.9375\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:93.8%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/110964/2344226-hudson_s_adventure_island__usa_.005.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2344226\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/110964/2344226-hudson_s_adventure_island__usa_.005.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/110964/2344226-hudson_s_adventure_island__usa_.005.png 256w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/110964/2344226-hudson_s_adventure_island__usa_.005.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/110964/2344226-hudson_s_adventure_island__usa_.005.png 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"></noscript></a></figure><p>The game has a wide variety of power ups, which can be found in eggs spread throughout the game's levels.

The player assumes the role of Worldrunner, also known as Jack, and must save several planets from strange alien creatures, led by the villian Grax. The game consists of 8 worlds, each divided into separate quadrants. The player must navigate through the level and defeat the endboss before a timer at the bottom of the screen runs out. Worldrunner is not controlled directly by the player, but his movement speed is changed by use of the directional pad. He can also jump and fire missiles, which must be obtained by the player. It was notable for being one of the first <a href=\"/25d/3015-660/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-660\">pseudo-3D</a> platformers.</p><p>One of the game's most unique features was the \"<a href=\"/stereoscopic-3d/3015-1204/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1204\">3-D mode</a>\", which was also featured in Square's <a href=\"/rad-racer/3025-418/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-418\">Rad Racer</a> for the NES. The Japanese <a href=\"/nes/3045-21/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-21\">Famicom</a> version utilized the Famicom 3D System, which used LCD shutter glasses to produce a true <a href=\"/stereoscopic-3d/3015-1204/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1204\">stereoscopic 3D</a> effect. In the North American <a href=\"/nes/3045-21/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-21\">NES</a> version, however, when the 3-D mode was activated, the graphics became anaglyph images; when viewed through the supplied red and cyan filtered anaglyph glasses, a Stereoscopic 3-D effect was achieved.

The game is seen from a top-down perspective, with players seeing the top of character's heads. The players are on the bottom of the screen, and advance upwards, while fighting through hordes of enemies. Players must be aware of how much ammunition they have, as it is limited. Tanks, which have armor that prevents our heroes from taking damage, can be commandeered throughout the game. However, they will eventually be destroyed by enemy fire.</p><p>The original Arcade version of Ikari Warriors allows players to move in one direction while firing in another. This is accomplished via a rotating joystick that allows players to aim in any of the eight movement directions. This style of gameplay made Ikari Warriors tough to duplicate in the numerous ports and remakes of the game that appeared on home consoles, with some, like the NES version, ignoring the feature completely and only allowing players to fire in the direction they're facing.</p><p>Clark and Ralf were required to move quickly in the game. If they loitered for too long, red spots, or tracking fire, would appear below them to get them on the move. Also when playing co-op if one player moved faster than another the slower player could become stuck and would die as a result.</p><h2>Home Ports</h2><p>The home versions of the game often departed from the level design of the Arcade game, with the NES version specifically getting a much longer game with more variety than the Arcade version. However, much of this new material was of a lower quality than the Arcade game.</p><p>The NES version of the game also has one of the most notoriously easy codes in the history of the system, which allows the player to continue from where they left off by pressing A, B, B, A after their last life is lost. The NES version also had a few bugs, like one co-op issue where a player would get dragged through some impassable object by the way the screen scrolls. After passing through the object, the player would be invincible to enemy fire, but invisible walls would often make forward progress tricky or even impossible.</p>", "expected_release_day": null,

After making it to America, however, Ryu is quickly captured by a young woman who proceeds to give him a demon statue. It is later revealed that bringing this demon statue to the other one similar to it would summon an ancient <a href=\"/demon/3015-557/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-557\">demon</a>, and would be sure death for every living thing.</p><figure style=\"width: 256px\" data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15051/455357-10.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-455357\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15051/455357-10.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-455357\"><img alt=\"Walter, commanding Ryu to chase after the ninja who stole the statue\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15051/455357-10.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15051/455357-10.jpg 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"></a><figcaption>Walter, commanding Ryu to chase after the ninja who stole the statue</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">After finding Walter, Walter reveals many things to Ryu, such as the relationship between the Light and Shadow demon statues.

Apparently he wants to summon the ancient demon. Foster requests that Ryu travels to <a href=\"/south-america/3035-2906/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2906\">South America</a> to eliminate The Jaquio and his followers.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Upon reaching the <a href=\"/temple/3035-1263/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1263\">temple</a>, it is discovered that The Jaquio has kidnapped <a href=\"/irene-lew/3005-16225/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-16225\">Irene Lew</a>, the young woman seen earlier in the game. The Jaquio offers her safety in return for the Shadow statue. Ryu hands over the Shadow statue, but a <a href=\"/trap-door/3055-2682/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2682\">trap-door</a> opens and Ryu falls into the low levels of the temple. After making his way back to the top, he finds that his father is still alive, but is possessed by a demon. Upon defeating the demon, The Jaquio is enraged, and proceeds to fire a <a href=\"/magic/3015-98/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-98\">magical</a> attack at Ryu. Ken jumps in the way to protect his son.

Ryu must traverse a stage filled with various enemies, whom he must dispatch with his <a href=\"/dragon-sword/3055-447/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-447\">sword</a>.

After defeating all of the foes within the level, Ryu will make it to a <a href=\"/bosses/3015-229/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-229\">boss</a> (whose health meter is next to Ryu's throughout the level). Typically, there is no secret to <a href=\"/boss-fight/3015-50/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-50\">destroying the boss</a>, its attacks are just incredibly hard to dodge making it very difficult for players who have lost health in other parts of the level.

For example, one gives him the ability to do a spin-attack when he jumps. This ability, known as Jump &amp; Slash made some boss fights too easy. It is possible to destroy the Kelbeross boss in a single hit, and to destroy the Bomberhead boss' chain weapon with it. This may have been a contributing factor to Jump &amp; Slash's omission from Ninja Gaiden 2. There are also items that merely increase the player's score by different amounts.

If the player is able to remove every tile on the board without getting stymied by locked tiles, they win the game. Though circles, bamboos, characters and dragons must be removed in identical pairs, a flower can be paired off with any other flower and the same is also the case for seasons.

Oddly, this game is still known as Blue Shadow in Europe.</p><h2>Story</h2><p>In 2029, an evil empire led by Emperor Garuda has taken over the world. Two ninjas, Hayate and Kaede, emerge from the shadows to topple the dictator and his army.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>In addition to the usual running, jumping and attacking, hanging from the bottom of platforms and climbing up plays a large role in traversing the game's stages.</p><h3>Weapons and Characters</h3><p>At the beginning of the game, players choose between Hayate or Kaede. They are quite similar, but Hayate has a longer range attack while Kaede attacks slightly faster. Throughout the game there are boxes which will reveal weapon power-ups when destroyed. If another copy of the weapon currently being used is picked up, it will be powered up to the next level. Weapons will be powered down by taking enough damage. If any other weapon is picked up it will replace the current weapon at power level one. The expendable weapons will be at whatever power the main weapon was when picked up.</p><ul><li><b>Sword</b>: The default weapon. It attacks quickly but has a short range, at least at its default power level. At the second level, a short energy wave is shot out with each swing, nearly doubling its range. At power level three the wave goes almost the length of the screen.</li><li><b>Chain</b>: A long range weapon which can be swung straight upwards and at a 45 degree angle as well as straight ahead. At power level one it is quite slow. Power level two makes it much faster, almost as fast as the sword. The third power level adds a short energy wave to the attack capable of hitting enemies which would normally be in the safe spot right in front of a character using this weapon. The chain is also notable for a glitch which can be exploited to attack much faster by repeatedly tapping 'Up\" during a jump attack.</li><li><b>Shuriken</b>: Long range throwing stars which are limited in supply. Power level two changes them into kunai (throwing daggers) which fly much faster. Power level three grants homing capabilities.</li><li><b>Bombs</b>: Very limited in supply but quite powerful. If the player can get to a boss with a couple, many of them go down pretty fast. Power level one drops straight down, while level two and three are tossed a short ways forward.</li></ul><p>There is also a hidden technique which can be performed to attack all enemies on the screen with lightning. To do it, hold down the attack button for about three seconds. The life meter will begin to flash and the attack will come out when the button is released. However, this will consume a large portion of the player's life.</p>", "expected_release_day": 10, "expected_release_month": 8, "expected_release_quarter": null, "expected_release_year": 1990, "guid": "3030-1768", "id": 1768, "image": {"icon_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/2362191-nes_shadowoftheninja.jpg", "medium_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_medium/2362191-nes_shadowoftheninja.jpg", "screen_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/screen_medium/2362191-nes_shadowoftheninja.jpg", "screen_large_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/screen_kubrick/2362191-nes_shadowoftheninja.jpg", "small_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_small/2362191-nes_shadowoftheninja.jpg", "super_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_large/2362191-nes_shadowoftheninja.jpg", "thumb_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_avatar/2362191-nes_shadowoftheninja.jpg", "tiny_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_mini/2362191-nes_shadowoftheninja.jpg", "original_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/2362191-nes_shadowoftheninja.jpg", "image_tags": "All Images,Box Art"}, "image_tags": [{"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-1768/?filter=image_tag%3AAll+Images", "name": "All Images", "total": 21}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-1768/?filter=image_tag%3ABox+Art", "name": "Box Art", "total": 6}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-1768/?filter=image_tag%3ANES+Screenshots", "name": "NES Screenshots", "total": 17}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-1768/?filter=image_tag%3AScreenshots", "name": "Screenshots", "total": 17}], "name": "Shadow of the Ninja", "number_of_user_reviews": 0, "original_game_rating": [{"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-38/", "id": 38, "name": "OFLC: PG"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-36/", "id": 36, "name": "PEGI: 12+"}], "original_release_date": null, "platforms": [{"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-21/", "id": 21, "name": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/nintendo-entertainment-system/3045-21/", "abbreviation": "NES"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-87/", "id": 87, "name": "Wii Shop", "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/wii-shop/3045-87/", "abbreviation": "WSHP"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-138/", "id": 138, "name": "Nintendo 3DS eShop", "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/nintendo-3ds-eshop/3045-138/", "abbreviation": "3DSE"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-139/", "id": 139, "name": "Wii U", "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/wii-u/3045-139/", "abbreviation": "WiiU"}], "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/shadow-of-the-ninja/3030-1768/"}, {"aliases": null, "api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-1777/", "date_added": "2008-04-01 01:40:28", "date_last_updated": "2017-04-27 23:34:26", "deck": "A horizontal shoot 'em up based on the hit Disney cartoon featuring characters inspired by The Jungle Book.

The Cyclone Sword Swing is a move where Leonardo stands still and swings his two swords around his body, which will hit anyone around him. The problem with this move is that it has a limited range and is best used when surrounded.</p><h3>Michaelangelo (Mike)</h3><p>The goofball and joker of the group, Mike (or sometimes called \"Mikey\") wears the orange bandanna. Like Raphael he is a short-range striker with his nunchuck weapons. His special ability is the Kangaroo Kick which is a front-hand spring where Mike jumps backwards on his hands and then pushes his body upward in an arc with his feet kicking forward. </p><h3>Raphael (Raph)</h3><p>Raphael is the independent and rebellious Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle of the group and wears a red-colored Bandana and wields the three-pronged sai short-ranged weapon. Raphael's reach is even shorter than that of Michaelangelo's which can make him a challenging choice. He makes up for this with the Power Drill Attack which is a spinning headbutt attack that launches Raph forward and damages any enemy in his way.</p><h3>Donatello (Don)</h3><p>Donatello wears the purple bandanna and wields a wooden bo staff. Donatello is the smartest and most knowledgeable Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle of the group and is not only level-headed but is always the Turtle that uses or builds devices and knows how to operate machinery and computers. Donatello is the easiest to use because of the long reach of his bo, he has the longest reach of all the characters. Additionally, Donatello's Knockout Roll is similar to Raphael's Power Drill Attack in that launches Donatello forward. In the move Donatello holds his staff out as he tucks in and spins forward vertically as he hits all the enemies in his path.</p>", "expected_release_day": 13, "expected_release_month": 12, "expected_release_quarter": null, "expected_release_year": 1991, "guid": "3030-1831", "id": 1831, "image": {"icon_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/2362301-nes_tmntiiithemanhattanproject.jpg", "medium_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_medium/2362301-nes_tmntiiithemanhattanproject.jpg", "screen_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/screen_medium/2362301-nes_tmntiiithemanhattanproject.jpg", "screen_large_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/screen_kubrick/2362301-nes_tmntiiithemanhattanproject.jpg", "small_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_small/2362301-nes_tmntiiithemanhattanproject.jpg", "super_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_large/2362301-nes_tmntiiithemanhattanproject.jpg", "thumb_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_avatar/2362301-nes_tmntiiithemanhattanproject.jpg", "tiny_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_mini/2362301-nes_tmntiiithemanhattanproject.jpg", "original_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/2362301-nes_tmntiiithemanhattanproject.jpg", "image_tags": "All Images,Box Art"}, "image_tags": [{"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-1831/?filter=image_tag%3AAll+Images", "name": "All Images", "total": 107}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-1831/?filter=image_tag%3ABox+Art", "name": "Box Art", "total": 2}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-1831/?filter=image_tag%3ANES+Screenshots", "name": "NES Screenshots", "total": 104}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-1831/?filter=image_tag%3AScreenshots", "name": "Screenshots", "total": 105}], "name": "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III: The Manhattan Project", "number_of_user_reviews": 0, "original_game_rating": null, "original_release_date": null, "platforms": [{"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-21/", "id": 21, "name": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/nintendo-entertainment-system/3045-21/", "abbreviation": "NES"}], "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-iii-the-manhattan-pro/3030-1831/"}, {"aliases": null, "api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-1848/", "date_added": "2008-04-01 01:40:44", "date_last_updated": "2019-03-06 16:14:21", "deck": "Nightshade is a humorous adventure game for the NES.", "description": "<p>Nightshade is a 1991 adventure game developed by Beam Software and published by Ultra Games. The game play is primarily point and click adventure, but turns to action during fighting segments. Nightshade is an up and coming super hero in the fictional city of Metro City. All of the criminal organizations of Metro City have been united by an Egyptian themed super villain named Sutekh. The city was previously protected by a super hero named Vortex who was murdered by Sutekh. The user interface features a health meter and a popularity meter. The popular meter is affected by the actions that Nightshade takes through out the game. Nightshade's popularity increases from doing good deeds and defeating enemies, and it decreases when Nightshade runs out of energy. The citizens of Metro City have a habit of calling Nightshade \"Lampshade\", although when Nightshade's popularity meter increases the citizens call him by the correct name. When Nightshade runs out of energy he is put in a death trap by Sutekh, and has to figure out how to get out of it. The first four times that this happens, it is possible to escape the death trap. The fifth time however, escape is not possible and the game is over. The game has a bizarre sense of humor, and bad puns are riddled through out. <br /></p>", "expected_release_day": null, "expected_release_month": null, "expected_release_quarter": null, "expected_release_year": null, "guid": "3030-1848", "id": 1848, "image": {"icon_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/2362086-nes_nightshade.jpg", "medium_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_medium/2362086-nes_nightshade.jpg", "screen_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/screen_medium/2362086-nes_nightshade.jpg", "screen_large_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/screen_kubrick/2362086-nes_nightshade.jpg", "small_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_small/2362086-nes_nightshade.jpg", "super_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_large/2362086-nes_nightshade.jpg", "thumb_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_avatar/2362086-nes_nightshade.jpg", "tiny_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_mini/2362086-nes_nightshade.jpg", "original_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/2362086-nes_nightshade.jpg", "image_tags": "All Images,Box Art"}, "image_tags": [{"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-1848/?filter=image_tag%3AAll+Images", "name": "All Images", "total": 13}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-1848/?filter=image_tag%3ABox+Art", "name": "Box Art", "total": 4}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-1848/?filter=image_tag%3ANES+Screenshots", "name": "NES Screenshots", "total": 9}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-1848/?filter=image_tag%3AScreenshots", "name": "Screenshots", "total": 9}], "name": "Nightshade", "number_of_user_reviews": 0, "original_game_rating": null, "original_release_date": "1992-01-31 00:00:00", "platforms": [{"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-21/", "id": 21, "name": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/nintendo-entertainment-system/3045-21/", "abbreviation": "NES"}], "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/nightshade/3030-1848/"}, {"aliases": "Ninja Gaiden 3\r\nNinja Ryuukenden III: Yomi no Hakobune", "api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-1850/", "date_added": "2008-04-01 01:40:44", "date_last_updated": "2016-02-28 22:06:01", "deck": "The last of the NES Ninja Gaiden trilogy.", "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Ninja Gaiden III: The Ancient Ship of Doom is a 1991 action-platformer which was the third and the final installment of <a href=\"/tecmo/3010-7421/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-7421\">Tecmo's</a> <a href=\"/ninja-gaiden/3025-472/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-472\">Ninja Gaiden series</a> to be released on <a href=\"/nes/3045-21/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-21\">NES</a>.

Now Ryu must prove himself innocent by finding the doppelg\u00e4nger who is impersonating him. The core gameplay remained the same from the first two installments but with noticeable differences and additions. The difficulty level was also ramped up by not only making the game just more difficult, but also by changing the way <a href=\"/continue/3015-635/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-635\">continues</a> work.

Apparently, Foster and Clancy were involved an experimentation, part of the \"Biohazard Plan\", using paranormal energies from a trans-dimensional rift created when Ryu killed The Demon within the ruins of Castle Rock Fortress. Using these energies, Foster created superhuman Bio-Noids, one of which was a doppelg\u00e4nger of Ryu. So, Ryu must infiltrate the base to clear his guilt away, while fighting through hordes of difficult monsters and <a href=\"/bosses/3015-229/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-229\">bosses</a> as well as his own

Dana, the protagonist, can push the blocks of ice if they are not connected to an edge, and can also climb on top of them. Dana can only create a block of ice in front of, and one tile below, where he is standing. The only interaction Dana has is the ability to climb up ledges and create, remove and push around blocks of ice. There is <a href=\"/no-jumping/3015-1852/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1852\">no jump button</a>.</p><p>The game's puzzle mechanics start off fairly simple, but quickly grow in complexity. Eventually pipes are added as an additional way to traverse levels, all in the name of putting out small fires. The games villain is the evil wizard Druidle. Dana begins Fire 'n Ice as a novice wizard, and gets his ice magic from The Queen of the Fairies.</p><h2>Story</h2><p>The story of Fire 'n Ice is told from the perspective of a child listening to his grandmother tell a story, similarly to the movie <em>The Princess Bride</em>.</p>", "expected_release_day": 24, "expected_release_month": 1, "expected_release_quarter": null, "expected_release_year":

The name Tetris is a portmanteau of the Greek prefix \"tetra\", which means \"four\", and Pajitnov's favorite sport, tennis.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Tetris challenges the player's spatial relation abilities by presenting them with different shapes made of four square blocks. The blocks are presented one at a time at the top of a rectangular play field, and quickly begin descending toward the bottom. The player can rotate the shapes and move them horizontally as they descend, and if they are able to make a complete horizontal line of blocks, that line will clear from the field. In its original form, Tetris was an endurance test, as the speed of the descending shapes would constantly increase as time went on, and the game would end when the play field filled completely with blocks.</p><h2>Tetris Variants</h2><p>A number of Tetris variations, both official and otherwise, have been released over the years, including <a href=\"/hatris/3030-17985/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-17985\">Hatris</a>, <a href=\"/welltris/3030-15385/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15385\">Welltris</a>, Super Tetris 2, <a href=\"/tetris-blast/3030-13982/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13982\">Tetris Blast</a> and <a href=\"/tetris-attack/3030-13130/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13130\">Tetris Attack</a>. Aside from spawning its own spin-offs, Tetris has been highly influential on a large number of puzzle games released in its wake.</p><h2>IP Rights</h2><p>The rights to Tetris have been greatly disputed over the years. At one point a British software house named Andromeda was going to purchase the rights, but before the deal with Pajitnov was settled, they sold the rights to <a href=\"/spectrum-holobyte-inc/3010-778/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-778\">Spectrum Holobyte</a>. Even though Andromeda's original deal with Pajitnov fell through, Spectrum Holobyte released what was essentially an unlicensed version of Tetris. After that point the rights began bouncing around, with <a href=\"/atari/3010-182/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-182\">Atari</a>, <a href=\"/nintendo/3010-90/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-90\">Nintendo</a>, the Soviet government, and other entities claiming ownership at various points.</p><h2>Additional Information</h2><figure data-align=\"right\"

can walk around town interacting with hint-providing NPCs, purchase equipment and items at stores and save the game.
