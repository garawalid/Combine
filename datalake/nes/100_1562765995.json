The game lets the wizard choose to pertain to one of four classes: fighter, wizard, archer, or dragonute. The game allows high customization of the character, including weapons, clothing, color schemes, armor etc. The game allows link up play with up to four players, to fight in cooperative combat. The gameplay presents itself as a typical hack-n-slash RPG, with the opbective of collecting gold, clothes, weapons etc. as well as constant hunting for experience points to level up.\u00a0 The game has a sequel called, simply <a data-ref-id=\"3030-14289\" href=\"/shining-soul-ii/3030-14289/\">  Shining Soul II</a>, in which the core gameplay remains practically the same but many extra features ($ new classes, collectible cards, arena, side quests etc.) are added. <br /><h2>Classes &amp; skills<br /></h2><b>Knight: </b><br /><i>Sword </i>- sword power up, charge attack <br /><i>Axe </i>- axe power up,\u00a0 charge attack <br /><i>Spear </i>- spear power up,\u00a0 charge attack <br /><i>Def build-up </i>- improves defense<br /><i>Efficacy </i>- increases recovery power of items<br /><i>Mentalpower </i>- raises immunity against attacks<br /><i>Cold res</i> - improves defense against cold<br /><i>Lightning res</i> - improves defense against thunder\u00a0 <br />\u00a0<br /><b>Wizard:\u00a0 </b><br /><i>Blaze </i>- spell that casts balls of fire<br /><i>Freeze </i>- spell that casts balls of ice<br /><i>Spark </i>- spell that casts thunderbolts<br /><i>Hellblast </i>- spell that casts tornado<br /><i>Inferno </i>- spell that reduces area to ashes<br /><i>Res </i>- improves resistance against magic<br /><i>Heal </i>- spell that recovers HP<br /><i>Slow </i>- Spell that slows down enemies <br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br /><b>Archer:</b><br /><i>Bow </i>- bow power up, charge attack<br /><i>Spear </i>- spear power up, charge attack<br /><i>Leap </i>- raises weapons' throwing range<br /><i>Critical </i>- increases chance of critical hit<br /><i>Healing </i>- HO recovers gradually<br /><i>Anti-flying</i> - more damage to flying enemies<br /><i>Fire res</i> - improves defense against flame<br /><i>Cold res</i> -\u00a0 imporoves defense against cold<br /><br /><b>Dragonute</b>:<br /><i>Axe </i>- axe power up, charge attack<br /><i>Flail </i>- flail power up, charge attack<br /><i>Brak armor</i> - lowers enemies' defense<br /><i>Emit </i>- counterattacks with brath<br /><i>Def build-up</i> - improves defense<br /><i>Undead </i>- more damage to undead enemies<br /><i>Fire res</i> - improves defense against flame<br /><i>Lightning res</i> - improves defense against thunder <br />\u00a0<br /><h2>Stages &amp; bosses</h2><b>Area 1</b><br /><b>Name:</b> Beast Mountain <br /><b>Number of levels:</b> 3<br /><b>Boss:</b> Beast King<br /><br /><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/106662/1520311-titan_fighter.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1520311\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 957px\" data-ratio=\"0.66457680250784\" data-width=\"957\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/106662/1520311-titan_fighter.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1520311\"><img alt=\"\u00a0Titan fighter.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/10/106662/1520311-titan_fighter.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/106662/1520311-titan_fighter.jpg 957w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/106662/1520311-titan_fighter.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/10/106662/1520311-titan_fighter.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0Titan fighter.</figcaption></figure><b>Area 2</b><br /><b>Name:</b> Labyrinth Death Shadow <br /><b>Nuumber of levels:</b> 7<br /><b>Boss:</b> Titan Fighter - a mighty war machine that shoots energy beams out of his eye-like sockets.

It was released in the United States on December 1, 1988. Originally, the game was only released on the <a href=\"/famicom-disk-system/3045-91/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-91\">Famicom Disk System</a> in Japan, and was converted in format to an NES cartridge game for American and European audiences.</p><p>As was the case for the original release of the first Legend of Zelda, Zelda II's original North American release used special gold-colored catridges. Across all territories, the game sold 4.8 million copies. Zelda II has since been rereleased on a variety of platforms in both physical and digital format, including the <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/game-boy-advance/3045-4/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-4\">Game Boy Advance</a>, <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/wii/3045-36/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-36\">Wii</a>, <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/nintendo-3ds/3045-117/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-117\">3DS</a>, and <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/wii-u/3045-139/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-139\">Wii U</a>.</p><h2>Franchise Influence</h2><p>Though many specifics of the game's format have not been used in the franchise since, it has had a strong influence on the franchise with elements it introduced. It was the first game in the series to feature towns houses that can be explored, and NPCs also have a much more expanded role and play a pivotal role in Link's journey. Zelda II is also the first game in the series to feature a proper magic system with a separate gauge used to measure Link's magical reserves.</p><p>Perhaps the most unique element of Zelda II is its side-scrolling action perspective. Sides-scrolling gameplay has not played a major role in the franchise since its use in this title, save for two of the three <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/cd-i/3045-27/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-27\">Philips CD-i</a> Zelda titles produced without Nintendo's involvement. However, sidescrolling elements would later be reused in a minor way in some of the handheld Zelda adventures.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Overworld</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5312/511932-zelda2aol_57.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-511932\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5312/511932-zelda2aol_57.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-511932\"><img alt=\"The overworld.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5312/511932-zelda2aol_57.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5312/511932-zelda2aol_57.png 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"></a><figcaption>The overworld.</figcaption></figure><p>Zelda II: The Adventure of Link eschews the gameplay format of the original <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/the-legend-of-zelda/3030-11949/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11949\">Legend of Zelda</a>, and no entry in the series has played like it since. While it keeps a top-down perspective for the overworld, combat does not directly take place from this viewpoint. Like many RPGs, the overworld perspective is used for travel throughout Hyrule, from town to town and dungeon to dungeon.</p><p>The overworld is broken down into segments which initially cannot be traversed until Link is able to acquire the appropriate item. For example, some routes are blocked by impassable boulders that cannot be circumvented in the early portions of the game. However, after Link acquires the hammer, he gains the ability to smash boulders, clearing these paths. In this way, the game keeps a sense of linearity where most dungeons need to be completed in a certain order so that the appropriate item can be obtained.</p><h3>Sidescrolling and Combat</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5312/511968-zelda2aol_48.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-511968\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5312/511968-zelda2aol_48.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-511968\"><img alt=\"Link takes on a dungeon boss.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5312/511968-zelda2aol_48.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5312/511968-zelda2aol_48.png 256w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Link takes on a dungeon boss.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5312/511968-zelda2aol_48.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5312/511968-zelda2aol_48.png 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Link takes on a dungeon boss.</figcaption></figure><p>When in the overworld, the player will find towns and caves to enter and explore, as well as roving icons representing monster encounters. When entering a town, dungeon, or a monster battle, the perspective shifts from overhead to a 2-D sidescrolling viewpoint in which Link is able to move left and right, jump, crouch, swing his sword, and guard using his shield. The majority of the game's primary action takes place in this viewpoint.</p><h3>Character Progression</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5312/511963-zelda2aol_23.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-511963\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5312/511963-zelda2aol_23.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-511963\"><img alt=\"Link visiting a town.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5312/511963-zelda2aol_23.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5312/511963-zelda2aol_23.png 256w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Link visiting a town.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5312/511963-zelda2aol_23.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5312/511963-zelda2aol_23.png 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Link visiting a town.</figcaption></figure><p>Link earns <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/experience-points/3015-39/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-39\">experience points</a> as he defeats enemies. Zelda II remains the only game in the franchise that features a proper experience point-based leveling mechanic. Each time Link levels up, he is able to spend experience points to upgrade one of three stats; his attack power, his magic gauge, or his health gauge. While exploring, the player can also acquire hearts or magic bottles that extend the maximum length of his health and magic gauges, respectively.</p><h3>Limited Lives</h3><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-511940\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5312/511940-zelda2aol_65.png\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5312/511940-zelda2aol_65.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-511940\"><img alt=\"The Game Over screen seen when Link loses all of his lives.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5312/511940-zelda2aol_65.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5312/511940-zelda2aol_65.png 256w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Game Over screen seen when Link loses all of his lives.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5312/511940-zelda2aol_65.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5312/511940-zelda2aol_65.png 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Game Over screen seen when Link loses all of his lives.</figcaption></figure><p>Unlike the other games in the series, the player has three lives when starting a game. When Link dies, either by running out of health or falling into a pit, he will restart at the entrance to the current screen. However, when Link has lost all of his lives, the game is over and the player has to restart from the North Castle; the starting point of the game. Extra lives in the form of small Link dolls can be found in secret locations around the world.</p><h3>Magic Spells</h3><p>The Adventure of Link was the first game in the series to feature a magic system. It is also the first game that provides Link with a list of spells, as well as a magic gauge that governs their usage. Similar to other role-playing games, any time Link uses a magic spell, it drains energy from the magic gauge. Link learns new spells as he travels, acquiring them from the wise men in each of the towns he visits on his quest. These spells don't come easy, however, as Link often has to complete side quests that involve such tasks as retrieving items and killing monsters before the wise men will teach him their spells. Many of the spells in the game are integral to the game's progress, such as the Jump spell that temporarily boosts Link's maximum jump height, or the Fairy spell that transforms Link into a small, flying fairy capable of crossing long gaps and chasms.</p><h2>Story</h2><p>Set after the original Legend of Zelda, The Adventure of Link revolves around Link's quest to remove a curse placed upon <a href=\"/zelda/3005-5/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-5\">Princess Zelda</a>. When her father the king passed away, the <a href=\"/triforce/3055-18/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-18\">Triforce</a> was supposed to go to Zelda\u2019s brother, the prince. However, the king, unsure of his son's true nature, had instead told Zelda the location of the final piece of the Triforce, the Triforce of Courage. The prince, eventually learning of this from a wizard, goes to Zelda, demanding to know the location of the Triforce of Courage, but Zelda refuses to tell him. The wizard casts a spell on the princess, causing her to sleep forever unless the full Triforce is recovered, but passes away before the prince can convince him to undo the spell. Realizing his error, the grief-stricken prince keeps Princess Zelda in the North Castle, where she is to sleep until her curse can be lifted. He also decreed that henceforth all princesses in Hyrule would be named Zelda.</p><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-528810\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7128/528810-zelda_ii_shadow.jpg\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"left\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7128/528810-zelda_ii_shadow.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-528810\"><img alt=\"Link must face his own shadow at the end of the game.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7128/528810-zelda_ii_shadow.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7128/528810-zelda_ii_shadow.jpg 256w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Link must face his own shadow at the end of the game.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7128/528810-zelda_ii_shadow.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7128/528810-zelda_ii_shadow.jpg 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Link must face his own shadow at the end of the game.</figcaption></figure><p>Following Link's triumph over Ganon in the original game, Ganon\u2019s minions are in a state of unrest, as his spirit still remains, but needs Link\u2019s blood in order to come back to life.

The SovKhan, a tyrannical overlord, rules the world from Megacity S1-9, a powerful military complex. The Guardians, an ancient order known for their strength of mind, has sworn to destroy Megacity S1-9, and bring down the SovKhan. Banished to the sewers, the Guardians stand no chance against the SovKhan and his powerful army of gigantic robotic war machines, known as the Slaves. The Guardians have managed to steal a single one of the Slave units, the original prototype, and have chosen their best man, Chan, to pilot it. Most humans are too weak to control a slave, but with the Guardians mind training, Chan becomes an exception. The game follows Chan, now permanently merged with the battle suit and transformed into Slave Zero, as he fights against the SovKhan's forces in Megacity S1-9.</p><h2>Gameplay </h2><p>Slave Zero places players in command of Slave Zero, a powerful robotic suit that comes equipped with various ballistic cannons, energy weapons, missiles and bombs.

Events in RapeLay range from groping on a train to gang rape and forced abortions.", "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p><i>RapeLay</i> is a 3D <a href=\"/rape/3015-2992/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2992\">rape</a> simulator by <a href=\"/illusion-software/3010-2375/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-2375\">Illusion Soft</a>, makers of the <a href=\"/artificial-girl/3025-933/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-933\"><i>Artificial Girl</i></a> series. The player takes the role of a rapist who stalks a family consisting of three young women, raping them repeatedly until their will breaks and they become his slaves.</p><h2>Story</h2><p>The main character is a sexual predator who attempts to grope a teenage girl named Aoi Kiryuu, only to wind up arrested when she screams bloody murder. Your wealthy parents bribe the police into letting you go, so you decide that as punishment for her wholly lawful act, you will rape Aoi, as well as her mother and younger sister.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p><i>RapeLay</i>'s gameplay is divided into three main parts:</p><ul><li><b>Phase One</b><br />The games begins with the player following their victim at the <a href=\"/train-station/3035-2249/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2249\">train station</a>. In this first phase one of the few things you can do is pray to the gods for a quick gust of wind that will blow up the victim's skirt, exposing her panties. Classy.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Phase Two</b><br />Once on the train, the assault begins, with a traditional Japanese train groping. Once the victim becomes aroused against her will, the train will conveniently stop, and the next phase of the game begins.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Phase Three</b><br />The third and final phase of every scene is the actual rape scene. The location of the rape depends on the character being raped. Yuuko's location is in the park, Manaka gets raped in a public <a href=\"/bathroom/3035-1639/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1639\">bathroom</a> and Aoi in her <a href=\"/bedroom/3035-1638/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1638\">bedroom</a>.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Free Phase</b><br />Once the \"story\" is done the player gains access to free play mode. Here, the player can select which character they wish to rape, and where this character should be raped. In addition to the three different rape locations that the player had access to in the story mode, three new locations become available: a hotel room, an alley and the <a href=\"/the-subway/3035-838/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-838\">subway</a> train itself. NPC rapists can be called on to add more people to the group. Also there are \"3 player\" and \"4 player\" modes available; not actually multiplayer, these are rapes in which a player has sex with two or all three of the girls in the game simultaneously. These only become available once a girl's will is broken: once she is bent to your will, you can bring her in to help molest one of her relatives. Again, <i>classy</i>.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Pregnancy and Abortion</b><br />Once \"Free Phase\" is unlocked the different girls can get <a href=\"/pregnancy/3015-2219/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2219\">pregnant</a> if you choose to ejaculate inside them during vaginal sex. If the child is born, the player will be thrown in front of the subway train. Forced abortion will result in the girl committing <a href=\"/suicide/3015-1408/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1408\">suicide</a> by poison pill.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Endings</b><br />There are only two different endings in <i>Rapelay,</i> both of which involve the player character dying. If you have sex with Aoi in the cowgirl position before her will is broken, you will get an ending where she takes advantage of the position to stab you to death with a pair of scissors. The other ending occurs if you impregnate a girl and let her carry her baby to term. Unwilling to let the child be raised by you, the mother pushes you in front of a train the next time you're at the subway station. There is no \"happy\" or \"good\" ending in RapeLay (at least not for the player character); if you avoid these two endings, the game lets you go on raping the women forever.</li></ul><h2>Nature of the Sex in <i><b>RapeLay</b></i></h2><p>Although the sex depicted in <i>RapeLay</i> is non-consensual, the actual rapes involve neither violence nor torture.

Chain of Memories continues the story of <a href=\"/sora/3005-693/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-693\">Sora</a> and his companions <a href=\"/donald-duck/3005-1754/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1754\">Donald</a> and <a href=\"/goofy/3005-1810/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1810\">Goofy</a> as they search for their missing friends. The story of the game takes place between <a href=\"/kingdom-hearts/3030-10983/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10983\">Kingdom Hearts</a> and <a href=\"/kingdom-hearts-ii/3030-4763/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-4763\">Kingdom Hearts II</a> (both exclusively PS2 titles). A Playstation 2 <a href=\"/kingdom-hearts-rechain-of-memories/3030-23845/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-23845\">remake of Chain of Memories</a> was released in Japan as part of the Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix+ release. The game utilizes a card based battle mechanic which combines the strategy of deck-building and the excitement of real time combat to create a unique style of gameplay.</p><p>Chain of Memories tells the story of Sora and his friends as they explore <a href=\"/castle-oblivion/3035-564/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-564\">Castle Oblivion</a>, searching for their missing friends. The further they travel into the dungeon, the more they begin to forget what has happened, and even what they're doing here. As they travel through the dungeon, they meet the members of <a href=\"/organization-xiii/3015-182/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-182\">Organization XIII</a>, a mysterious group with an unknown agenda. Many of the worlds from the original Kingdom Hearts make a return in Chain of Memories, including <a href=\"/agrabah/3035-859/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-859\">Agrabah</a>, <a href=\"/wonderland/3035-477/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-477\">Wonderland</a>, and <a href=\"/halloween-town/3035-781/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-781\">Halloween Town</a>, as well as the new world of <a href=\"/twilight-town/3035-273/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-273\">Twilight Town</a>.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>The gameplay in Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories is a hybrid of the action role-playing style of the Kingdom Hearts series and a collectible card game. Worlds are broken up into a series of rooms, however progression in the worlds is tied to what map cards are used to unlock the next level.</p><p>Combat is played in real time. Sora can jump and run freely, but attacking, magic, summons, and using cards requires cards from the player's deck. All cards are ranked on a scale from 0 to 9 and can be used in comboes or to card break opponents, canceling the attack and/or stunning them temporarily. Cards with higher ranks trump cards with lower ranks (8 beats 4, for example). Placing cards in a deck costs CP (card points), and cards with higher numbers require more CP. 0 cards can be used to break any other card, but only after the enemy card has been played. Otherwise, the player can suffer from card break. Three cards of the same type result in a combo, adding the total of the three cards together to make it more difficult to card break. Some combinations of cards will produce stronger attacks, magic, items, or summons. However, when using cards in a combo, the first card cannot be re-used until the next battle. When the player uses up all the cards in the deck, the deck has to be reshuffled to continue battling (done by standing still and holding the A button).</p><p>When playing as Sora, you can customize up to three decks. Cards are earned through battle or by buying them through Moogle shops. Some cards are unlocked after story events.</p><p>When playing as <a href=\"/riku/3005-1405/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1405\">Riku</a>, after the main storyline has been completed, his deck cannot be customized, but the cards in the deck change depending on the current world. However, Riku has a dark mode, activated by card breaking the opponent several times, that make his deck more powerful in combat for a period of time.</p><h2>Card Types</h2><p><b>Attack Cards:</b> These are the most common card types. You collect different attack cards with different numbers on them showing their power. It can go from 0 to 9. The higher the number on the card is, the harder it is for the enemies to card-break you. The 0 card although it is easily breakable can always break other cards no matter what their number is.</p><p><b>Magic Cards:</b> These have ranges like the attack cards from 0-9 with the same capabilities but this time you get to do long range attacks as well as summons. You can stack the magic cards for an improved attack (for example if it's fire card, stack 2 for fira and stack 3 for firaga)</p><p><b>Friend Cards:</b> These cards are different depending on the level. You get different friends on different worlds and you can use them for special attacks. Again their range goes from 0-9 and they are stackable for more powerful and more difficult to break attacks.</p><p><b>Item Cards:</b> These cards contain different items such as potions and elixirs that benefit to Sora in the battle. Those cards can only be used once per battle and have the usual 0-9 numbers.</p><p><b>Enemy Cards:</b> These cards are different than the others, you only get them after defeating a special enemy (bosses always drop them) or after killing the same enemy numerous times, they will drop their card. They all have different effects that can change the battle such as higher jumps, health regeneration and more.</p><p><b>Trick Cards:</b> These cards only drop in special battles such as boss fights and once you activate it, it unleashes an attack that will leave the enemy without any defense, giving you the perfect opportunity to attack. Those often drop but still be sure to use them wisely.</p><p><b>Premium Bonuses:</b> These cards are extremely rare and only drop from some enemies. When you get one of those, after your fight a screen will open showing you the possibility to upgrade one of your cards to a premium card costing less CP than the normal ones.</p><p><b>Map Cards:</b> These cards are dropped when finishing a battle most of the time and they allow you to continue in the other room. There are different world cards like red ones, blue, green and gold. Each decide what the other room is going to look like. The red ones have effects such as an increased number of Heartless while the Blue ones can have \"Moment's reprieve' in which you can save the game. When going to a boss battle, you will be asked to have different cards to pass.</p><p><b>World Cards:</b> These cards are used in the beginning of a level and they allow you to choose which world you want to go to.</p>", "expected_release_day": 7, "expected_release_month": 12, "expected_release_quarter": null, "expected_release_year": 2004, "guid": "3030-16706", "id": 16706, "image": {"icon_url":

to find Hans, the sole heir to a factory and eventually ends up on a journey to find him and the once thought to be extinct Mammoths.", "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Syberia is a third-person traditional <a href=\"/point-and-click/3015-75/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-75\">Point and Click</a> adventure game released in 2002 from <a href=\"/microids/3010-800/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-800\">Micro\u00efds</a>. Originally conceived by <a href=\"/benoit-sokal/3040-59452/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-59452\">Beno\u00eet Sokal</a>. Syberia combines traditional PC adventure gaming with a dramatic plot, believable characters and a unique art direction that lends the game a very surreal atmosphere.</p><h2>Plot</h2><p>The player takes the part of <a href=\"/kate-walker/3005-1057/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1057\">Kate Walker</a>, an employee of a law firm who travels to Europe to close a deal on the acquisition of a toy factory. As she investigates, she finds out that the heir, Hans, has been gone for some time to find the once thought to be extinct Mammoth's. Unwillingly, she goes to find him to close the deal. During the time she tries to find him, she gives up wanting to continue with her job and peruses the Mammoth's with Hans.</p><h2>Inspiration</h2><p>Syberia draws heavily from steam punk fiction and features mechanical toys, automatons and a train using the steam punk technology. The steam punk aspect runs heavily through the story, being used on various objects. Syberia is also set in the same fictional universe as <a href=\"/amerzone-the-explorers-legacy/3030-3234/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-3234\">Amerzone</a>, another game designed by Sokal. Several references to Amerzone can also be found throughout the game.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>The gameplay in Syberia is similar to that of any point-and-click adventure, with the player able to control Kate and move her around environments searching and exploring for items, clues and information that will allow the player to progress through the locations and storyline. The vast majority of Syberia relies on information gathering (i.e. talking to the games many NPC's), finding items that can then be used to interact with other items or in-game objects (example: Putting voice cylinders into a music box to play back the recordings) and solving puzzles. As such, the gameplay has the same issues as most adventure games in that, at times, if the player is unsure of what they are supposed to be doing they can find themselves running around fairly large environments inspecting anything and everything in the hopes of triggering an event.</p><p>A large portion of the game revolves around the Train that Kate boards fairly early on. This train wil make several stops on its journey, each stop bringing Kate to a new location and requiring the player to overcome new obstacles and complete tasks for the right people in order to get the train running again and move on to the next area. At each stop, Kate normally must speak to the local residents to learn more about the area and help to overcome some of the problems of the characters, which will usually provide some kind of reward, be it a physical item that Kate needs to solve another puzzle, or information regarding some of the major characters in the plot.</p><h2>Locations</h2><p>As Kate Walker you are taken on a journey through many exotic locales. Beginning in a remote town in France you are then transported through Cental and Eastern Europe.</p><h3><b>Valadil\u00e8ne</b></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17628/777724-vale.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-777724\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"600\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17628/777724-vale.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-777724\"><img alt=\"Valadil\u00e8ne\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/17628/777724-vale.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17628/777724-vale.jpg 600w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/17628/777724-vale.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>Valadil\u00e8ne</figcaption></figure><p>Syberia begins in the fictional French town of Valadil\u00e8ne.

It had some ambitious heights to scale and a great deal of expectations that it's <a href=\"/best-selling-games/3015-1525/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1525\">critically-acclaimed</a> predecessor had set. Vice City managed not only to do that, but it also raised the bar of <a href=\"/open-world/3015-207/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-207\">open-world</a> gaming in every aspect we would think of. The game is set in the luminous era of 80's in the hedonistic tropical paradise of <a href=\"/vice-city/3035-16/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-16\">Vice City</a>; a neon-lit metropolis with shining beaches, loosely based on the real-world <a href=\"/miami/3035-787/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-787\">Miami</a>.</p><h2>Plot</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1927/180381-2804.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-180381\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.7\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:70.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1927/180381-2804.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-180381\"><img alt=\"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1927/180381-2804.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1927/180381-2804.jpg 640w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1927/180381-2804.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1927/180381-2804.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Grand Theft Auto: Vice City</figcaption></figure><p>Players assume the role of <a href=\"/tommy-vercetti/3005-14/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-14\">Tommy Vercetti</a>, a <a href=\"/the-mafia/3015-1294/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1294\">Mafia</a> hitman who is a highly ambitious go-getter, no nonsense kind of guy. He is back after serving fifteen years in prison for a killing spree. The Mafia family of Liberty City send him down \"south\" to Miami as opposed to Liberty City, to avoid bringing unwanted attention that could be brought by Tommy's return. They set up a drug deal in Vice City in which Tommy is supposed to participate in the Mafia's hopes to gain a strong foothold down south. The deal goes sour, Tommy's comrades are killed, and he is left in a new city without any money, with little to turn to and a big debt the pay off. [Unlike GTA III's mute protagonist, Tommy Vercetti has <a href=\"/voice-acting/3015-1413/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1413\">dialogues</a>, which really do well to create his unique persona.]</p><p>Despite the failure of the deal, <a href=\"/sonny-forelli/3005-4571/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4571\">Sonny Forelli</a> decides to give Tommy a chance to get the drugs and the money back. Tommy promises to get back the lost goods and kill those responsible. He decides to turn to Ken Rosenburg, who escaped the ambush at the deal with him, to decide their next move.</p><p>Ken informs Tommy about a big party going down on the yacht of <a href=\"/colonel-juan-garcia-cortez/3005-4574/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4574\">Colonel Juan Garcia Cortez</a>. Using Ken's invitation, he attends the party and is introduced (although not in person) to several of Vice City's most important people. A loud mouthed <a href=\"/ricardo-diaz/3005-1593/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1593\">Ricardo Diaz</a> arrives, and Tommy takes the Colonel's daughter to the strip club at her request. Following the party, Tommy tells Ken that they need someone from the street, and Ken suggests that they confront <a href=\"/kent-paul/3005-4538/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4538\">Kent Paul.</a> Tommy meets Kent Paul at The Malibu, a dance club where Kent is seen unsuccessfully trying to woo a woman. After a confrontational meeting, Kent tells Tommy about a chef who might be involved. Tommy kills the chef after an unproductive interrogation. In the process he meets <a href=\"/lance-vance/3005-196/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-196\">Lance Vance</a>, who gives him a handgun and shows him the local Ammu-Nation store.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1675/367871-00064258.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-367871\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.5875\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:58.8%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1675/367871-00064258.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-367871\"><img alt=\"Take that innocent VCR!\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1675/367871-00064258.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1675/367871-00064258.jpg 640w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1675/367871-00064258.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1675/367871-00064258.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Take that innocent VCR!</figcaption></figure><p>Despite the fact that he's met some people, Tommy still hasn't found what he's looking for. For the next few days, Tommy performs jobs for Cortez and even Diaz as well as others. One mission involves him and Lance Vance overseeing a deal between Diaz and a group of Haitians. The Haitians turn on Diaz, but Tommy and Lance open fire. Diaz barely escapes with his life. Following the deal, Diaz asks Tommy to meet his friend Quentin. Apparently someone has been selling real estate on his watch, and he is pissed off about that. In reality, Quentin is actually Lance Vance. Diaz killed Lance's brother and he is convinced that Tommy is next. Together they do the job asked of them, but now Tommy knows to keep a close eye on Diaz</p><p>Diaz has clearly lost his mind (although that assumes he even had a sane mind to begin with). Tommy witnesses him shooting his VCR after it fails to operate correctly and firing at birds that make the mistake of landing on his car. Diaz's next mission for Tommy is to steal a boat that apparently is faster than his. Nobody can have a faster boat than Diaz, so Tommy takes it and drives it over to the mansion. However, Tommy learns about someone that moors their boat off the coast and sells their stuff to the first person that gets to them. Using the fast boat he just stole, Tommy as well as Lance beat everyone else to the freelancer. Eventually the two collect enough information to prove that Diaz is the one responsible for the deal at the beginning of the game going wrong.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/56/224205-full_vc_08.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-224205\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/56/224205-full_vc_08.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-224205\"><img alt=\"It would be unwise for one to mess with Tommy Vercetti\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/56/224205-full_vc_08.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/56/224205-full_vc_08.jpg 1280w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/56/224205-full_vc_08.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/56/224205-full_vc_08.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/56/224205-full_vc_08.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"It would be unwise for one to mess with Tommy Vercetti\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/56/224205-full_vc_08.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/56/224205-full_vc_08.jpg 1280w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/56/224205-full_vc_08.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/56/224205-full_vc_08.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/56/224205-full_vc_08.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>It would be unwise for one to mess with Tommy Vercetti</figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, Lance, who's eager to get revenge for the killing of his brother, attempts to take out Diaz himself. He fails miserably and is taken hostage in a junkyard. Tommy rolls in guns blazing and manages to free Lance from the clutches of Diaz's henchman. At this point, Tommy realizes it's now or never; they need to remove Diaz from Vice City. Tommy arrives at Diaz's mansion with Lance. Lance apparently has been stockpiling guns for quite some time; he opens the trunk of his car and the two grab assault rifles. A massive assault begins on the mansion and after a ferocious gunfight Diaz is executed in his own home. Tommy assumes control of the mansion and he, along with Avery Carrington (who gave him missions earlier), Lance Vance, and Ken Roseburg establish the Vercetti gang. Tommy at this point is allowed to start buying real estate throughout Vice City, which in turn generates revenue for him to collect. It may seem like Tommy is on top of the world, but he still has $3,000,000 to collect and pay to Sonny Forelli.</p><p>After a few more missions, one of which involved stealing cop uniforms and blowing up a section of the mall, Sonny decides that he isn't going to wait any longer. He sends someones down to Vice City to collect the money. Tommy creates $3,000,000 in counterfeit cash, but not before killing the man Sonny sent down for the money. Sonny arrives at the mansion, and Tommy hands over the fake money. Then, the unthinkable happens. Lance Vance, who is wildly upset that he isn't getting his fair share of Tommy's money, informs Sonny that the cash is fake. A raid begins on Tommy's mansion, but Tommy manages to kill Lance, Sonny, and all of Sonny's men. Now, with his boss and the maniac he once considered a friend out of the picture, Tommy returns to controlling Vice City.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/28666/1363493-homer.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1363493\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.7515625\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.2%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/28666/1363493-homer.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1363493\"><img alt=\"The flamethrower in action\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/28666/1363493-homer.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/28666/1363493-homer.jpg 640w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/28666/1363493-homer.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/28666/1363493-homer.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The flamethrower in action\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/28666/1363493-homer.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/28666/1363493-homer.jpg 640w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/28666/1363493-homer.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/28666/1363493-homer.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The flamethrower in action</figcaption></figure><p>The core gameplay design and interface in Vice City remains roughly the same as in GTAIII, other than few interesting twists and added extras. This is very much a Grand Theft Auto title, which means players can steal or \"jack\" vehicles, kill pedestrians, cause mayhem, escape from the <a href=\"/police-chase/3015-489/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-489\">cops</a>, etc. Most of the story progresses through \"missions\" or \"jobs\" which will be given out to Tommy by his various employers at various stages. Later in the game he will have to purchase real estate to have access to some of the missions. Much of the mission design remains same and many of the missions involve eliminating targets either on foot or in vehicle, completing a certain deal, or driving over contacts to a fixed location and so on. However, many of Vice City's missions are truly unique and their novelty adds to the fun of playing the game. Addition of <a href=\"/motorcycle/3055-366/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-366\">motorcycles</a> and <a href=\"/helicopter/3055-361/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-361\">helicopters</a> in Vice City is a welcome change.</p><p>The ability to buy businesses like a night club, a <a href=\"/taxi-cab/3055-1139/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1139\">taxi company</a>, film studio, printing press, <a href=\"/strippers/3015-2080/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2080\">strip club</a> or car showroom is another addition to Vice City, this is the main generator of income in the game. These businesses once bought unlock a couple of side-missions which need to be completed in order for the businesses to generate revenue. Players could also participate in illegal street races and earn money. As usual there are rampages, stunts and hidden packages - a tradition in GTA games by now.</p><p>Vice City also features some vehicles that weren't seen in Grand Theft Auto III, such as helicopters and motorcyles. There is also a flyable plane that is remarkably easier to pilot compared to the Dodo from GTA III.</p><h2>Soundtrack</h2><h3>Emotion 98.3</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14036/609306-emotion.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-609306\" data-size=\"large\" data-ratio=\"0.48427672955975\" data-width=\"159\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 159px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:48.4%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14036/609306-emotion.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-609306\"><img alt=\"Emotion 98.3\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 159px) 100vw, 159px\" data-width=\"159\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14036/609306-emotion.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14036/609306-emotion.png 159w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Emotion 98.3\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14036/609306-emotion.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14036/609306-emotion.png 159w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 159px) 100vw, 159px\" data-width=\"159\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Emotion 98.3</figcaption></figure><p><b>DJ:</b> Fernando Martinez</p><p><b>Genre:</b> Power ballads, Rock</p><p><b>Tracklist:</b></p><ul><li>Foreigner -

from the insidious, balloon-toting wolves in Konami's Pooyan.", "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>In Pooyan, the player controls a pig confined to an elevator on the right side of the screen. The player can move the elevator up and down, and fire arrows which fly to the left. Every few seconds, a meat arrow appears at the top of the elevator's rope. Moving the elevator to the top of the screen will pick up the meat arrow, automatically firing it the next time the fire button is pressed.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Gameplay consists of an endless cycle of three rounds. In the first round of each cycle, the wolves begin at the top of the screen, and attempt to descend using balloons while throwing missiles at the player. Shooting the wolves themselves does no good; the player must shoot the balloons, causing the wolves to plummet to their demise. The wolves usually descend one or two at a time, but every so often a group of four or five descend at once to add to the challenge. The meat arrow comes in handy for these groups; if the meat arrow flies near the wolf, the wolf will immediately fall as it tries and fails to grab the meat. This allows meat arrows to clear several wolves with one shot. If a wolf reaches the bottom safely, it will climb a ladder to the right of the player (where it cannot be hit), periodically reaching out to snap at the player. The player can lose a life by being hit by a thrown missile (only the pig is vulnerable -- hitting the elevator does not count), or by being chomped on by a wolf on the ladder.</p><p>Once enough wolves are cleared, the player advances to the second round, where the wolves start at the bottom and attempt to rise to the top using helium balloons. This time the balloons take multiple hits to pop if they are not hit squarely. Wolves that reach the top will line up behind a huge rock, attempting to push it down the elevator's path. The final wolf of this round rises on a multicolored balloon that is unusually hard to pop; if this wolf reaches the top of the screen, five more wolves will appear, extending the round. The player can lose a life either by being hit by a thrown missile, or by allowing seven wolves to reach the top of the screen, at which point they succeed in pushing the rock and crushing the player.</p><p>The third round of the cycle is a bonus stage. The wolves rise from the bottom just like in the second round, but the player is given an infinite number of meat arrows (and must use them -- regular arrows are not available). The player receives bonus points for clearing the wolves using as few shots as possible.</p>", "expected_release_day": null, "expected_release_month": null, "expected_release_quarter": null,

Knights</figcaption></figure><p>The game opens with Bomberman flying in a spaceship back to his home planet accompanied by a strange egg, when his ship is sucked into a black hole. Bomberman loses consciousness, and later awakes to find himself in a jail cell with the mysterious egg, but without the Fire Stone that allows him to use his trademark bombs. The egg hatches shortly afterwards, and the creature that emerges introduces himself as Pommy. Pommy is able to slip through the bars of the cell to retrieve Bomberman's Fire Stone, and with it Bomberman is able to escape. The two later learn that they were imprisoned by henchmen working for the Astral Knights, an evil group collecting the seven Elemental Stones. Bomberman and his new friend set out to stop the Astral Knights from executing whatever they're planning.</p><p>The Story Mode has eight levels, each one a planet with a different theme. Each planet has a boss fight against one of the Astral Knights, six of whom carry an elemental stone. Gameplay is much like that of <a href=\"/bomberman-64/3030-17348/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-17348\">Bomberman 64</a>, although 64's spherical explosions have been replaced with the traditional cross shaped explosions found in 2D entries of the series. One of the biggest additions to The Second Attack are the new types of bombs that Bomberman can use. After most boss fights Bomberman collects a new Elemental Stone that allows him to use a new type of bomb. These new bombs often must be used to advance past certain sections, such as using ice bombs to freeze water or wind bombs to blow Bomberman across a gap.</p><p>The other big addition to The Second Attack is Pommy. At first Pommy can aid Bomberman by stunning enemies, but he can evolve into stronger forms with different attacks if Bomberman collects enough food. The type of food that Bomberman collects will affect what Pommy evolves into. Pommy can either be controlled by the AI or a second player.</p><h2>Battle Mode</h2><p>The Second Attack features five multiplayer modes; Survival, Battle Royal, King &amp; Knights, Key Trial, and Score Attack. The options allow players to change the number of rounds it takes to win and the amount of time in each round. Some modes also have options for ghosts, sudden death, and shuffle.</p><p>Survival Mode is the traditional Bomberman multiplayer mode. Four players try to blow each other up, and the last player left standing is declared the winner.</p><p>In Battle Royal players receive ten points for killing another player, and lose five points for dying. The player with the most points when time runs out wins.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/71263/2456035-save_the_king.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2456035\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.75\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/71263/2456035-save_the_king.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2456035\"><img alt=\"Promotional art of Bomberman protecting his king from the opposing team\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/7/71263/2456035-save_the_king.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/71263/2456035-save_the_king.jpg 1024w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/7/71263/2456035-save_the_king.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/7/71263/2456035-save_the_king.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>Promotional art of Bomberman protecting his king from the opposing team</figcaption></figure><p>In King &amp; Knights the players are split into two teams and must protect an inanimate king while trying to kill the other team's kings. Each king has either 4, 7, or 10 hit points depending on how the player set the game up. Players can pick up and move either king, which is an integral part of ensuring they're safe.</p><p>In Key Trial two keys are hidden within objects in the map, and players compete to collect both keys. If a player with a key is caught in an explosion they'll drop it, allowing any player to pick it back up.

It's up to Kirby and his friends to gather all the Crystal Shards throughout six different planets and cleanse Ripple Star of Dark Matter.</p><p>The Crystal Shards was digitally re-released (via <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/virtual-console/3015-2925/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2925\">Virtual Console</a>) for both the <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/wii/3045-36/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-36\">Wii</a> (on February 25, 2008) and the <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/wii-u/3045-139/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-139\">Wii U</a> (on July 30, 2015). The Wii version was also used in the <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/kirbys-dream-collection-special-edition/3030-38070/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-38070\">Kirby's Dream Collection</a> compilation to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the series.</p><h2>Abilities</h2><p>While there are seven core abilities in the game, Kirby can merge two abilities into one combination ability (by either inhaling both ability enemies at the same time, by spitting an ability enemy onto another, or by transferring his ability into an Ability Star and throwing it an ability enemy to create a combination Ability Star). There are twenty-eight combination abilities in the game.</p><h3>Stand-alone Abilities</h3><ul><li><strong>Bomb:</strong> Allows Kirby to throw bombs in front of him.</li><li><strong>Cutter:</strong> Kirby throws his face in the shape of a boomerang. His walking speed is slower when using this ability.</li><li><strong>Fire:</strong> Kirby transforms into a ball of fire that propels him forward for a brief amount of time.</li><li><strong>Ice:</strong> Kirby breathes ice that freezes enemies when hit.</li><li><strong>Needle:</strong> Kirby grows spikes that kill enemies, Kirby also sticks to any surface when using this ability.</li><li><strong>Spark:</strong> Electricity surrounds Kirby, hurting any enemy that he touches.</li><li><strong>Stone:</strong> Kirby turns to stone and squashes anything that's under him, Kirby can still move around in this form but the ability stops if Kirby falls off a ledge.</li></ul><h3>Combination Abilities</h3><ul><li><strong>Bomb+Bomb:</strong> Kirby shoots up to 3 rockets from his mouth.</li><li><strong>Bomb+Cutter:</strong> Kirby throws ninja stars that explode on impact with an enemy.</li><li><strong>Bomb+Fire:</strong> Kirby shoots fireworks and can launch himself in the air.</li><li><strong>Bomb+Ice:</strong> Kirby turns into a snowman that detonates on impact with an enemy.</li><li><strong>Bomb+Needle:</strong> Kirby turns into a Gordo, and when Kirby explodes he shoots needles around him.</li><li><strong>Bomb+Spark:</strong> Kirby turns into a light bulb that explodes after a brief amount of time.</li><li><strong>Bomb+Stone:</strong> Kirby throws dynamite that explodes after a brief amount of time. This can also damage Kirby if the player does not push down to put Kirby's hard hat on.</li><li><strong>Cutter+Cutter:</strong> Much like the stand alone Cutter ability, except the range of the Boomerang is bigger and the actual Boomerang is bigger.</li><li><strong>Cutter+Fire:</strong> Kirby gets a fire sword that he can swing around. The sword can be thrown and can also hurt enemies when it is dragged from behind.</li><li><strong>Cutter+Ice:</strong> Kirby puts on ice skates and skates along the level.</li><li><strong>Cutter+Needle:</strong> Kirby's arms grow into fangs that close when Kirby is on the ground to attack anything around Kirby.</li><li><strong>Cutter+Spark:</strong> Kirby uses a light saber-esque weapon to attack enemies.</li><li><strong>Cutter+Stone:</strong> Kirby transforms into stone, and then carves himself into some of Kirby's friends. The friends include Rick the Hamster, Coo the Owl, Kine the Fish, Pitch the Bird, Chuchu the Octopus, and Nago the cat.</li><li><strong>Fire+Fire: </strong>Much like the stand alone fire ability. Except Kirby travels further in a ball of fire, and there is more fire so the range is larger.</li><li><strong>Fire+Ice:</strong> Kirby gets put into a block of ice, which then melts away.</li><li><strong>Fire+Needle:</strong> Kirby transforms into a bow that shoots flaming arrows.</li><li><strong>Fire+Spark:</strong> Kirby gets caught on fire making him run around, hurting any enemies he touches.</li><li><strong>Fire+Stone:</strong> Kirby transforms into a volcano, and is able to shoot rocks at enemies.</li><li><strong>Ice+Ice: </strong>Kirby rolls into a big snowball, hurting any enemy he touches.</li><li><strong>Ice+Needle:</strong> Kirby transforms into a giant snowflake.</li><li><strong>Ice+Spark:</strong> Kirby transforms into a refrigerator, and can hurl food at enemies.

The spikes are actually a fork, a needle, a bee's sting, a cactus, a corkscrew, a pencil, and protractor.</li><li><strong>Needle+Spark:</strong> Kirby transforms into a needle that conducts lightning.</li><li><strong>Needle+Stone:</strong> Kirby has a power drill that drags him forward, hurting the enemies it hits.</li><li><strong>Spark+Spark:</strong> Similar to the stand alone spark ability, except the spark is larger.</li><li><strong>Spark+Stone:</strong> Kirby spits out a large rock that is lassoed by electricity, giving it a boomerang

with the player being given a device (the VRU) by Professor Oak which allows them to communicate with Pokemon, they then use the device to communicate with and befriend a wild Pikachu. The player then goes on a series of daily adventures with Pikachu such as fishing, gathering food in a forest for a feast with other wild Pokemon, or just exploring a large field of flowers. At the end of each day the player receives \"Pika Points\" from Pikachu, a currency which can be used to buy items, such as new toys, from Abra. After 1 year (365 days) worth of days, Oak again appears, telling the player they must release Pikachu (who has come to live in the player's home) as he is a wild Pokemon. After a series of goodbyes, Pikachu is left in the forest as the player returns home. However, the next day, Pikachu comes back; now living in the forest, but returning to adventure with the player each day.</p><h2>Trivia</h2><p>If the player of Hey You, Pikachu says \"Playstation,\" Pikachu will become angry at the player.</p><p>Hey You, Pikachu was the only game released in the US to use the VRU.</p>", "expected_release_day": 12, "expected_release_month": 12, "expected_release_quarter": null, "expected_release_year": 1998, "guid": "3030-17113", "id": 17113, "image": {"icon_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/2171267-box_hyp.png", "medium_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_medium/2171267-box_hyp.png", "screen_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/screen_medium/2171267-box_hyp.png", "screen_large_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/screen_kubrick/2171267-box_hyp.png", "small_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_small/2171267-box_hyp.png", "super_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_large/2171267-box_hyp.png", "thumb_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_avatar/2171267-box_hyp.png", "tiny_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_mini/2171267-box_hyp.png", "original_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/2171267-box_hyp.png", "image_tags": "All Images,Box Art"}, "image_tags": [{"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-17113/?filter=image_tag%3AAll+Images", "name": "All Images", "total": 9}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-17113/?filter=image_tag%3ABox+Art", "name": "Box Art", "total": 3}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-17113/?filter=image_tag%3AE3+2000", "name": "E3 2000", "total": 5}], "name": "Hey You, Pikachu!", "number_of_user_reviews": 0, "original_game_rating": [{"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-6/", "id": 6, "name": "ESRB: E"}], "original_release_date": null, "platforms": [{"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-43/", "id": 43, "name": "Nintendo 64", "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/nintendo-64/3045-43/", "abbreviation": "N64"}], "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/hey-you-pikachu/3030-17113/"}, {"aliases": null, "api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-17639/", "date_added": "2008-04-01 16:35:13", "date_last_updated": "2019-06-22 14:19:52", "deck": "An early polygonal shooter for the PC by Action Forms, developers of the Carnivores series.", "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Chasm: The Rift is a first-person shooter for the PC developed by <a href=\"/action-forms-ltd/3010-3725/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-3725\">Action Forms</a>, and published in 1997 by <a href=\"/wizardworks-software/3010-308/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-308\">WizardWorks</a>, <a href=\"/gt-interactive-software-corp/3010-479/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-479\">GT Interactive</a> and <a href=\"/megamedia-corp/3010-400/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-400\">MegaMedia</a>.

On this quest to stop the evil forces, he visits places ranging from military bases in the present to tombs in ancient Egypt. One of the notable features of the game is the ability to remove limbs from enemies. The bosses in the game have to be brought down by special tactics instead of raw firepower.

Boxes of shells (coming in sets of 10 or 20) are also very common throughout the game.</li><li><strong>Volcano</strong><i> - </i>A chaingun type weapon with, initially, limited ammo.</li><li><strong>Blade Gun</strong><i> - </i>Shoots blades.</li><li><strong>Laser Crossbow</strong><i> - </i>A crossbow that fires laser bolts.</li><li><strong>Grenader</strong><i> - </i>Shoots rocket-propelled grenades.

Rolling over smaller items causes them to stick to the katamari, increasing its size and allowing the player to collect larger objects.\u00a0In this game however, the object is not to recreate any stars, but to fulfill different requests made by fans of the first game. This includes rolling up an illuminated Katamari of fireflies to help a homeless student study in the dark, or rolling up all the clouds in the sky in order to save a child's field trip from being ruined by rain.<br/> At the end of each successfully completed level, the Katamari becomes either star dust or a planet. The player has the option to try and beat the game at any point by using another Katamari in an un-timed outer-space level to roll up the planets and star dust they create in the game. If enough planets have been created, the player can roll the sun in their Katamari.<br/><br/> There is also a multi-player component to the game, where two players\u00a0simultaneously\u00a0push the same Katamari.</div><div><br/><h2>Soundtrack\u00a0\u00a0 <br/></h2>The soundtrack to We Love Katamari was released in Japan in 2005 and is similar in style to the original.

It was developed by Game Freak for the Nintendo Game Boy, and is essentially an updated version of the Pok\u00e9mon Red/Blue titles, with changes made in order for the game to more closely follow the events of the Pok\u00e9mon anime series.</p><p>Perhaps the most significant change from the previous versions is the fact that players are no longer given the choice of the three Starter Pok\u00e9mon (Squirtle, Bulbasaur and Charmander), but are instead given a Pikachu by Professor Oak at the start of the game (as also occurs in the anime series). Pikachu follows the character around the world instead of being stored in a Pok\u00e9 Ball, and its personality and attitude towards the player can be affected how you play the game (frequently fainting causes Pikachu to become hostile towards you, for example).</p><h2>Parallels to Anime</h2><p>One of the ideas behind Pokemon Yellow was to tie into the anime, starting from a redesign of all the characters, and even the Pokemon. Gary, Professor Oak and, most notably, Misty and Brock have been redesigned to look more like the characters from the anime. The player's starter is always Pikachu, and Gary starts with an <a href=\"/eevee/3015-2004/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2004\">Eevee</a>. Gary has no fan club, however, as he does in the show.</p><p><a href=\"/team-rocket/3015-1469/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1469\">Team Rocket</a> is a major player as per the original games, but Jesse and James are now actual characters, using <a href=\"/koffing/3015-1992/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1992\">Koffing</a>, <a href=\"/ekans/3015-1267/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1267\">Ekans</a> and <a href=\"/meowth/3015-1961/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1961\">Meowth</a>. <a href=\"/giovanni/3005-8870/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-8870\">Giovanni</a>, the boss of Team Rocket, has had his team overhauled to be more in tune with his anime counterpart, including a <a href=\"/persian/3015-2113/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2113\">Persian</a>.</p><p><a href=\"/pokemon-center/3035-3480/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-3480\">Pokemon Centers</a> are now staffed by <a href=\"/nurse-joy/3005-17155/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-17155\">Nurse Joy</a> counterparts, as well as <a href=\"/chansey/3015-1993/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1993\">Chanseys</a>. Your character also has the option of getting all the starter Pokemon again, and in similar ways to the show: Bulbasaur is given away by a girl after you defeat Misty because she feels he's being held back by staying there with her; Charmander is given away by some dude who doesn't want it anymore; Squirtle is given away by Officer Jenny for being too much of a rabble-rouser.</p><p>Most importantly, however, is Pikachu, as mentioned before, and the fact it follows you around. It even goes through stages similar to those of the Pikachu in the show, where it at first distrusts you but then grows to enjoy you more. It also refuses to be evolved if you try (making you have to trade over a Pikachu from another game if you want a Raichu).</p><h2>Differences from Red/Blue</h2><p>This game is mostly an update to the games, and a lot of the gameplay changes are cosmetic. Genders, abilities and breeding aren't introduced until later games, and the game is mostly at the simplest RPG roots (see Gameplay below). Other changes are enumerated above as just making it more like the anime, so in the end, the other biggest change is for collectors of the Pokemon. The exclusive Pokemon in this version are a mix of both games, making it far easier to catch them all. Some of the trades have been changed as well, or removed completely (the man who traded you the Jynx in Red/Blue is replaced by the girl who gives you Bulbasaur, for example). It's an incremental upgrade, and set the standard for Crystal and Emerald coming further down the line.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>The gameplay in Pok\u00e9mon Yellow is based upon the <a href=\"/turn-based/3015-192/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-192\">turn-based</a> battle system that debuted in Red/Blue version. The player's Pok\u00e9mon are only allowed to have a maximum of 4 attacks. There are different kinds of attacks, such as special attacks and physical attacks. The attacks and all Pok\u00e9mon are also all divided in types, such as water type, fire type, rock type, psychic type, and should a Pok\u00e9mon use an attack with similar type to his he gains a boost in damage. The Pok\u00e9mon are able to learn new abilities; however, since they are only allowed to have 4 attacks, the player must choose wisely if he or she wishes to forget an attack in order to learn a new attack, for a forgotten technique can not be recovered in most cases.</p><p>Learning new attacks require the Pok\u00e9mon to <a href=\"/leveling-up/3015-475/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-475\">level up</a>. Leveling up happens by gaining <a href=\"/experience-points/3015-39/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-39\">experience points</a> when challenging and defeating other Pok\u00e9mon, which can be from other trainers or random Pok\u00e9mon found in the wild. When facing another trainer the player will have to choose a Pok\u00e9mon in their inventory to battle one of the opponent's Pok\u00e9mon, if emerging victorious, the trainer will also earn money used buy items such as <a href=\"/potion/3055-79/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-79\">potions</a>, <a href=\"/poke-ball/3055-425/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-425\">Pok\u00e9 Balls</a>, etc. When enough experience is collected, the Pok\u00e9mon will be able to learn certain attacks based on their type, the attack and which level is happens depends on the Pok\u00e9mon. The player is also allowed to switch Pok\u00e9mon in mid-battle if the situation permits it; however, the Pok\u00e9mon switched and the Pok\u00e9mon which was switched for will divide the experience received equally should the enemy be downed. This strategy allows players to level up weak Pok\u00e9mon quickly if done correctly. And if the player levels up their Pok\u00e9mon to a certain level, the Pok\u00e9mon will evolve. Evolving allows the Pok\u00e9mon to take on a new form, becoming stronger and being able to learn attacks that it wouldn't be able to learn before. But if the player wishes for their Pok\u00e9mon to stay at that stage, he or she can rapidly tap the B button to stop the evolution when the evolution screen sets in.</p><p>When players put their Pok\u00e9mon into battle, they will most likely receive damage eventually. If the Pok\u00e9mon are injured too much, the player must take them to the Pok\u00e9mon Center in order for the Pok\u00e9mon's <a href=\"/hit-points/3015-400/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-400\">Hit Points</a> (HP) to be fully restored and all stat changes be restored to normal. But if there isn't a Pok\u00e9mon Center nearby, players are able to buy potions and other healing items to heal their Pok\u00e9mon during or after battle. Players can buy potions from Pok\u00e9Marts located throughout the game as well as finding the items scattered around during the adventure. The player is only able to buy a maximum of 99 of each different type of item. Like any RPG, items play a decisive role in the game, some items give the ability to teach a Pok\u00e9mon techniques, even some which the Pok\u00e9mon wouldn't normally learn though leveling up, these are called Technical Machines (TM), and they work as normal attacks would do when taught to any Pok\u00e9mon able to receive such technique, though there are 50 of them in the game, each TM can only be used once, being rendered useless afterwards; though most of them can only be attained once, some of them can be bought in shops and can theoretically be used how many times the player wishes, granting the player has the money to buy. There's another kind of technique called Hidden Machines (HM), this can be used as much as the player wants, it doesn't lose effect after usage, and though they can also used to attack during battle, their primary function is to help the player overcome certain natural obstacles during the adventure, such as cutting trees obstructing the way, or surfing. A Pok\u00e9mon is required for these actions and once the Pok\u00e9mon learns a Hidden Machine they will never unlearn it.</p><p>In order to catch Pok\u00e9mon, the player requires to have Pok\u00e9balls. A Pok\u00e9ball allows a player to capture any wild Pok\u00e9mon in the game. Some Pok\u00e9mon are stronger than others; therefore, it requires the player to weaken them first with his or her Pok\u00e9mon before it can be caught. Pok\u00e9balls are purchased from the Pok\u00e9Mart. There are different types of Pok\u00e9balls, and each of them have a different percentage of effectiveness on catching Pok\u00e9mon. Since the player is only able to carry a maximum of 6 Pok\u00e9mon within their inventory any extra Pok\u00e9mon caught is instantly sent to be stored in the PC. If a player decides to switch Pok\u00e9mon, then they would be required to go to a <a href=\"/pc/3045-94/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PC</a> located in any Pok\u00e9mon Center to do so, from there, the player is allowed to switch whatever Pok\u00e9mon that he or she has already caught from their PCs to their inventory and vice-versa.</p><p>Your primary goal in Pok\u00e9mon Yellow is becoming the greatest Pok\u00e9mon trainer of all, to to achieve that you have to train Pok\u00e9mon to take on the Elite Four, which is formed by the very four best Pok\u00e9mon trainers around, after taking down all the Pok\u00e9mon from the four trainers you still have to face the Elite Champion to, then, if you manage to win the battle, become the newest champion. To do that you won't have access to Pok\u00e9mon Center's care for your Pok\u00e9mon and you will have to deal with the six Pok\u00e9mon you choose in the beginning against all 5 trainers, it is allowed to stock up items and use them in any of your Pok\u00e9mon at will, but changing one Pok\u00e9mon downed for some other with full health won't be allowed. When you beat the Elite and the champion your name and Pok\u00e9mon will go down in the hall of fame. You can still come back and battle the Elite Four anytime after you beat them the first time, it's actually one of the best places in the game for easy and high amount of experience, and you also receive money out of each trainer defeated, making it a great monetary source as well.</p><h2>Pok\u00e9mon Gyms</h2><p>During the adventure you'll have to face 8 different gym leaders and beat them to acquire their badges, and with them, get allowed into Victory Road and reach Indigo Plateau for the Elite. Each Pok\u00e9mon Gym Leader is an specialist in some <a href=\"/pokemon/3015-549/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-549\">Pok\u00e9mon</a> type, it's important to notice their type for better chances of counter-attacking with a strong type Pok\u00e9mon. Here are the gym leaders, their location, their specialty and Pok\u00e9mon used.</p><h3>Pewter City Gym</h3><p>Leader - Brock</p><p>Badge - Boulder Badge</p><p>Pok\u00e9mon Type - Rock/Ground</p><p>Pok\u00e9mon Used - Geodude, Onyx</p><h3>Cerulean City Gym</h3><p>Leader - Misty</p><p>Badge - Cascade Badge</p><p>Pok\u00e9mon Type - Water</p><p>Pok\u00e9mon Used - Staryu, Starmie</p><h3>Vermilion City Gym</h3><p>Leader - Lt.

The evolution will depend on your actions in the game, here are the three sets of Pok\u00e9mon he might be using</p><p><i>With Vaporeon</i> - Sandslash, Alakazam, Exeggutor, Ninetales, Magneton</p><p><i>With Jolteon</i> - Sandslash, Alakazam, Exeggutor, Ninetales, Cloyster</p><p><i>With Flareon</i> - Sandslash, Alakazam, Exeggutor, Cloyster, Magneton</p><h2>Evolving Gary's Eevee</h2><p>Gary's Eevee evolution hinges on the first two battles with him-first in Oak's office and then in the route outside of Viridian, before the Pokemon League entrance. They proceed as follows:</p><h3>Vaporeon</h3><p>To get Vaporeon, you must lose both battles with him (alternately, you could just skip the second battle, which counts as a loss). Presumably this is to make his later battles easier, since Pikachu is super-effective against water. A cunning trainer would let Gary win both times, though, and just use this to destroy him easier later.</p><h3>Flareon</h3><p>Win one, lose the other. It doesn't really matter which you win and which you lose, but it's easier to win the first match and then, once more, skipping the second battle.</p><h3>Jolteon</h3><p>Process of elimination should show that to get him to fight with a Jolteon, simply win both matches. It's the hardest evolution, because you're not very effective against it with your Pikachu.</p><h2>Technical Machines</h2><p>Here's a list of all Technical Machines found in the game.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><b>Technical Machines</b></td><td><b>Attack</b></td></tr><tr><td><b>-</b></td><td><b>-</b></td></tr><tr><td>TM01</td><td>Mega Punch</td></tr><tr><td>TM02</td><td>Razor Wind</td></tr><tr><td>TM03</td><td>Sword's Dance</td></tr><tr><td>TM04</td><td>Whirlwind</td></tr><tr><td>TM05</td><td>Mega Kick</td></tr><tr><td>TM06</td><td>Toxic</td></tr><tr><td>TM07</td><td>Horn Drill</td></tr><tr><td>TM08</td><td>Body Slam</td></tr><tr><td>TM09</td><td>Take Down</td></tr><tr><td>TM10</td><td>Double Edge</td></tr><tr><td>TM11</td><td>Bubble Beam</td></tr><tr><td>TM12</td><td>Water Gun</td></tr><tr><td>TM13</td><td>Ice Beam</td></tr><tr><td>TM14</td><td>Blizzard</td></tr><tr><td>TM15</td><td>Hyper Beam</td></tr><tr><td>TM16</td><td>Pay Day</td></tr><tr><td>TM17</td><td>Submission</td></tr><tr><td>TM18</td><td>Counter</td></tr><tr><td>TM19</td><td>Seismic Toss</td></tr><tr><td>TM20</td><td>Rage</td></tr><tr><td>TM21</td><td>Mega Drain</td></tr><tr><td>TM22</td><td>Solar Beam</td></tr><tr><td>TM23</td><td>Dragon Rage</td></tr><tr><td>TM24</td><td>Thunderbolt</td></tr><tr><td>TM25</td><td>Thunder</td></tr><tr><td>TM26</td><td>Earthquake</td></tr><tr><td>TM27</td><td>Fissure</td></tr><tr><td>TM28</td><td>Dig</td></tr><tr><td>TM29</td><td>Psychic</td></tr><tr><td>TM30</td><td>Teleport</td></tr><tr><td>TM31</td><td>Mimic</td></tr><tr><td>TM32</td><td>Double Team</td></tr><tr><td>TM33</td><td>Reflect</td></tr><tr><td>TM34</td><td>Bide</td></tr><tr><td>TM35</td><td>Metronome</td></tr><tr><td>TM36</td><td>Self Destruct</td></tr><tr><td>TM37</td><td>Egg Bomb</td></tr><tr><td>TM38</td><td>Fire Blast</td></tr><tr><td>TM39</td><td>Swift</td></tr><tr><td>TM40</td><td>Skull Bash</td></tr><tr><td>TM41</td><td>Soft Boiled</td></tr><tr><td>TM42</td><td>Dream Eater</td></tr><tr><td>TM43</td><td>Sky Attack</td></tr><tr><td>TM44</td><td>Rest</td></tr><tr><td>TM45</td><td>Thunder Wave</td></tr><tr><td>TM46</td><td>Psywave</td></tr><tr><td>TM47</td><td>Explosion</td></tr><tr><td>TM48</td><td>Rock Slide</td></tr><tr><td>TM49</td><td>Tri Attack</td></tr><tr><td>TM50</td><td>Substitute</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Hidden Machine</h2><p>Here's a list of all Hidden Machines found in the game.</p><table><tbody><tr><th>Hidden Machine</th><th>Ablity</th></tr><tr><td>HM01</td><td>Cut</td></tr><tr><td>HM02</td><td>Fly</td></tr><tr><td>HM03</td><td>Surf</td></tr><tr><td>HM04</td><td>Strength</td></tr><tr><td>HM05</td><td>Flash</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Surfing Pikachu</h2><p>One of the new features in Pok\u00e9mon Yellow is the possibility to play a mini-games called \"Surfing Pikachu\", you just had to show up at the house near the beach in route 19 and have a Pikachu who knows the technique \"Surf\" as one of his four moves.

Ressok, The mutant shaman leader or \u201cHimmuk\u201d of the Mardok village gathers the top three contenders in front of the elders to determine who is going to deal with the hume threat.</p><p>It is at this point where you chose one of three playable characters in selecting the game\u2019s protagonist. There\u2019s Dekker the human, who uses a <a href=\"/knife/3055-295/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-295\"> knife</a> and is quite weak. Jakka is a half mutant female with eye beam attack and Varigg \u2013 a big green mutant who\u2019s tough, but can\u2019t move freely in some \u201chume\u201d areas of the game later on. Jakka is able to get away with movement in these areas because she can hide her mutation behind her \u201ceyeblast\u201d patch.</p><p> </p><p>Aside from some additional tasks that Varigg has to do, the game is<a href=\"/linear-gameplay/3015-383/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-383\"> linear </a>in progression and follows the travel here, find that,take it there, use it on that, talk to them approach to gameplay. The gaming area is large by standards of the day and consists of <a href=\"/desert/3035-1179/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1179\"> desert </a>wastelands bound by rivers and rocky outcrops, a subway system, various villages, ruined cities and fortifications on the mutant plains. The game finishes in an underground bunker facility where your quest for peace in the plains ends with a confrontation with the evil Equitus.</p><p> </p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>The screen real-estate is divided into a large foreground picture with a TV set and a green bottle. The huge green bottle represents player health by faintly emptying as health is lost. The TV screen contains the actual game-play area. Controls on the TV set indicate keyboard keys that access the players inventory, or allow them to talk to NPCs, use or examine items, change game options or save the game.</p><p>Player movement in the game is limited to either X or Y directions only. There is no diagonal player movement in the game, which can impair evading enemies that can move diagonally. Most of the playable area in the game is post nuclear wasteland containing re-spawing creatures called \u201cbuzzars\u201d, \u201cturkles\u201d and \u201curse\u201d. Often, food items that replenish your health meter are left behind after battle.</p><p> </p><p>There is no player map in the game, although a GPS co-ordinate display unit can be found later on. This display aids navigation between points of interest considerably. Initially, the playable area is bound by rocks and water, but a boat becomes available during the game that allows the player to reach new areas. The relentless questing can become confusing and the textual style of the game does not aid comprehension of the plot too much. The final underground bunker has some obtuse switch-flicking puzzles and a vital final area is impenetrable without using a \u201cvibrablade\u201d found earlier story, making this a difficult game to complete.</p><p> </p><h2><strong>Retail Box Description</strong></h2><p>PULSE-POUNDING Arcade Action!</p><p>RADIOACTIVE Roleplaying!</p><p>The Ultimate Post-Apocalypse Saga!</p><p>ARE YOU MUTANT ENOUGH TO HANDLE IT?</p><p>In a world devastated by nuclear holocaust, the pure-blooded humans have sworn to exterminate their mutant cousins.

The game received considerable acclaim for its brightly colored graphics, expansive plot, \"Ring Command\" menu system, innovative real-time battle system, modified <a title=\"Active Time Battle\" href=\"/active-time-battle/3015-95/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-95\">Active Time Battle</a> meter adapted for real-time action, its innovative <a href=\"/cooperative-play/3015-108/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-108\">cooperative multiplayer</a> gameplay, where the second or third players could drop in and out of the game at any time rather than players having to join the game at the same time, the customizable <a href=\"/artificial-intelligence/3015-218/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-218\">AI </a>settings for computer-controlled allies, and the acclaimed soundtrack by <a title=\"Hiroki Kikuta\" href=\"/hiroki-kikuta/3040-89609/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-89609\">Hiroki Kikuta</a>. Secret of Mana was an influential game in its time, and has remained influential through to the present day, such as its customizable AI for player characters being used by many later games, its ring menu system still used in modern games (such as <a title=\"The Temple of Elemental Evil (video game)\" href=\"/the-temple-of-elemental-evil-a-classic-greyhawk-ad/3030-11474/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11474\">The Temple of Elemental Evil</a>) and its cooperative multiplayer mentioned as an influence on games as recent as <a title=\"Dungeon Siege III\" href=\"/dungeon-siege-iii/3030-20718/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20718\">Dungeon Siege III</a>.</p><p>Secret of Mana also largely pioneered the action RPG <a href=\"/stamina-bar/3015-3569/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3569\">stamina bar</a> mechanic, which has since been adopted by a number of action RPGs, including <a href=\"/kings-field/3025-1348/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1348\">King's Field</a>, <a href=\"/souls/3025-2169/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-2169\">Souls</a>, <a href=\"/bloodborne/3030-46569/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-46569\">Bloodborne</a>, and <a href=\"/nioh/3030-27578/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-27578\">Nioh</a>.</p><h2>Development</h2><p>The game was developed by <a href=\"/squaresoft/3010-6323/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6323\">Squaresoft</a>, designed and produced by <a href=\"/hiromichi-tanaka/3040-61873/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-61873\">Hiromichi Tanaka</a>, and programmed by <a href=\"/nasir-gebelli/3040-61871/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-61871\">Nasir Gebelli</a>. This was the same team that had produced <a href=\"/final-fantasy-iii/3030-21463/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21463\">Final Fantasy III</a>, which Gebelli used as a basis for programming Secret of Mana.</p><p>According to Tanaka in <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20121215045204/www.squareenixmusic.com/features/liners/seikendensetsubox.shtml\">2011</a> and <a href=\"http://legendsoflocalization.com/final-fantasy-iv-secret-of-mana-and-chrono-trigger-had-a-connection/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">2013</a>, the game was originally intended to be <a href=\"/final-fantasy-iv/3030-20829/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20829\">Final Fantasy IV</a>, before becoming a new project called <a href=\"/chrono-trigger/3030-9249/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-9249\">Chrono Trigger</a>, and then eventually Secret of Mana. In his own words:</p><blockquote><p>After we finished FFIII, we started FFIV with the idea of a slightly more action-based, dynamic overworld rather than keep combat as a completely separate thing. But, at some point, it wound up not being IV anymore\u2026 Instead, it was eventually released as \u201cSeiken Densetsu 2\u2033 (Secret of Mana), but during development it was actually referred to as \u201cChrono Trigger\u201d. (laugh)</p><p>At the time, just after FFIII, we were working with Mr. Toriyama on a game with a seamless, side-view system. A CD-ROM attachment for the Super Famicom was scheduled to be released, you see. So we had this enormous game planned out for the CD-ROM attachment, but ultimately we were never able to release it.</p><p>So we had the Chrono Trigger project changed to a new game, and this other game we had been working on was condensed down into Seiken Densetsu 2. Because of this, Seiken 2 always felt like a sequel to FFIII to me.</p></blockquote><p> </p><h2>Plot</h2><blockquote><p>Using the power of Mana, a civilization had grown strong... In time, Mana was used to create the ultimate weapon: the Mana Fortress... This angered the Gods. They sent their beasts to destroy the Fortress... A violent war rocked the world, and Mana seemed to disappear.... Before all was lost, a hero with the Mana Sword smashed the fortress... Though the civilization had been destroyed, the world was peaceful again. But time flows like a river...and history repeats.</p></blockquote><p>When a boy finds a <a href=\"/sword/3055-1/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1\">sword</a> on the outskirts of his village, he only wanted a tool to cut through the brush to get home. What he got was the legendary <a href=\"/sword-of-mana/3030-2248/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2248\">Sword of Mana</a>, drained of power and in need of someone to wield it. By pulling the sword free, the young man releases monsters in the surrounding forest. The boy is subsequently banished from his village, and embarks on a quest to reforge the Mana Sword. Joined in his travels by a Princess and Sprite child, the boy becomes the hero that the world needs, and will search the world for the Mana seeds and fight an empire that seeks to repeat the mistakes of history and revive the Mana Fortress.</p><h2>Characters</h2><h3><b>The Heroes</b></h3><p>While the internet likes to give the heroes names, none of the releases of the game, nor the manual or other material (such as Nintendo Power), provide default names for the characters. Supposedly these are the translated names from the Japanese manual, but this has never been confirmed. These names are included here for continuity with other material from the Secret of Mana gaming community.</p><h4><a href=\"/randi/3005-2236/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2236\">The Boy / The Hero, \"Randi\"</a></h4><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10174/228269-randi.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-228269\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"2.375\" data-width=\"80\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 80px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:237.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10174/228269-randi.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-228269\"><img alt=\"The Boy\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10174/228269-randi.gif\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10174/228269-randi.gif 80w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 80px) 100vw, 80px\" data-width=\"80\"></a><figcaption>The Boy</figcaption></figure><p>The boy is an orphan in the town of Potos raised by the town elder.

The directional pad moves the currently controller character around, and the face buttons are used for attacking, activating items and dialogue, and opening the game's unique \" ring\" menu system.</p><p>There are three characters playable in the game, and all are on-screen for the majority of the game. When not under player control, a character's actions are assumed by the game's <a href=\"/artificial-intelligence/3015-218/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-218\">artificial intelligence</a> (AI), following the player character around and attacking on their own. This AI has a notoriously weak path-finding system, often causing characters to get stuck. The game provides an \"action grid,\" where the behavior of an AI controlled ally can be tweaked. There are various settings between aggressive and defensive, and the power level of attacks can be adjusted. The player can also use the AI allies \"ring menu\" to cast magic. With the use of a multi-tap peripheral, all three characters can be player-controlled, making Secret of Mana one of the first co-op console games with more than two players. This occasionally had unintended consequences as the players could attempt to go different directions, 'trapping' all the players in the active screen and preventing forward momentum.</p><h3>Combat</h3><p>Combat is a simple case of facing the character towards an enemy, and pressing the attack button. At the bottom of the screen there is a 'power bar' for each character. This displays the character's current <a href=\"/hit-points/3015-400/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-400\">hit points</a> (HP) and the character's current combat state. If an attack is made, a small counter on the bar quickly fills back up to 100% - if another attack is made before it reaches 100% then that attack is slightly weaker. This means the player must time their attacks correctly to deal the most damage.</p><p>Holding the attack button down will charge up the power bar. It will fill up as many times as that character has leveled up in their weapon. When the button is released, the character will perform a <a href=\"/special-attack/3015-327/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-327\">special attack</a>, which has varying power depending on how long it has been charged. Some special attacks deal more damage, or more hits, or will connect with more enemies at once. Up to 8 levels of each weapon could be unlocked per character. The weapons also had individual characteristics (whips could cross chasms, spears could attack enemies from a far, Bows could shoot enemies on far away platforms, etc.)</p><p>The heroes fight a maximum of three enemies on screen at any time.</p><h3>Magic</h3><p>The heroes will eventually gain the ability to summon the eight Mana elementals and cast magic. The boy is unable to cast any magic, as his Mana sword will eventually be more powerful than any magic. The sprite gains the ability to cast offensive magic. The girl gains the ability to cast primarily defensive and restorative magic.</p><p>As the world's mana seeds are unlocked by the mana sword, the potential of the heroes mana magic increases. Each elemental can be leveled to a maximum of eight levels. An allies skill in a particular magic increases as it is used. The following levels becomes increasingly harder to obtain. So, for example, while a elemental might reach level 1 from level 0 after casting a spell 10 times, it could take casting the spell 100 times to move from level 7 to level 8. The increase in an elemental's level not only increases the power of the magic's effect, but also causes a subtle change in that spells graphical effects, which get more elaborate as the spells level up.</p><p>Spells are cast using the games \"ring menu\" system, and combat continues while a spell is being cast. For a short period at the beginning of a spell, the character summoning the mana elemental cannot be moved. Once this summoning is complete, all characters can continue to move and fight as the spell is cast.</p><p>The exception to this is \"Level 9\" spells. When spells reach their maximum level of 8, the player can continue to gain magic experience up to level 8.99. \"Level 9\" spells can occur at any point after level 8.01. The closer the player is to level 8.99, the more often they occur. They also occur more while \"mashing\" the attack button during casting. These rare \"Level 9\" spells freeze all action in the game while they occur. They have increase graphical effects. For example, fireballs become dragons. These \"Level 9\" spells also increase the spells effect greatly.</p><p>Magic can be targeted to a single target or to all applicable targets. For example, cure water can be used to cure a single ally, or can be cast on all allies. An offensive spell can be cast on a single target or all targets on screen. A spell's effect is greatest on a single target.</p><p>The mana elementals and their spells are listed in the order they are obtained:</p><h4><a href=\"/undine/3005-3279/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3279\">Undine - Water Elemental</a></h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10234/292486-undine.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-292486\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.064\" data-width=\"250\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 250px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:106.4%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10234/292486-undine.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-292486\"><img alt=\"Undine - The Water Elemental\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10234/292486-undine.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10234/292486-undine.jpg 250w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Undine - The Water Elemental\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10234/292486-undine.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10234/292486-undine.jpg 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Undine - The Water Elemental</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"/undine/3005-3279/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3279\">Undine</a> is found in Undine's cave.

There are eight different weapons and they are shared by the three playable characters, that is, one weapon may not be wielded by more than one character at once. During the course of the game, the player characters will come across 'orbs'. When taken to a character in the game known as \"Watts\", he will 'forge' the orb into the corresponding weapon allowing for a higher level capacity. Additionaly, certain levels of weapon evolution have other benefits, such as the ability to deal extra damage to a certain class of enemies or inflict certain status effects.</p><p>The orbs were usually awarded to the player for completing the game's quests and dungeons, however due to the game being scaled down to fit on the Super Nintendo cartridge, some weapons' orbs were dropped by standard enemies in the final dungeon.</p><p>Each different weapon is listed as follows, in the order they are obtained, with the name for each level of upgrade. Many weapons also have other unique gameplay abilities, just as cutting obstacles or pulling characters across gaps.</p><h4><a href=\"/sword/3055-1/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1\">Sword</a></h4><p>The sword is the first weapon gained in the game, found near the river in the beginning of the game. It is a close range weapon, which can also be used to cut down certain obstacles in the world like bushes. The sword in it's ninth level, as the Mana Sword, is by far the most powerful weapon in the game. The Mana Sword can only be unlocked properly via the use of \"Mana Magic\" in the game's final battle. It can be unlocked earlier by using a glitch in the game to get an extra sword orb.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/878166-screen004.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-878166\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.8671875\" data-width=\"512\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 512px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:86.7%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/878166-screen004.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-878166\"><img alt=\"The boy pulling the rusty sword from a tree stump.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4527/878166-screen004.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/878166-screen004.jpg 512w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4527/878166-screen004.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4527/878166-screen004.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The boy pulling the rusty sword from a tree stump.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4527/878166-screen004.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4527/878166-screen004.jpg 512w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4527/878166-screen004.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4527/878166-screen004.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The boy pulling the rusty sword from a tree stump.</figcaption></figure><ol><li>Rusty Sword</li><li>Broad Sword</li><li>Herald Sword</li><li>Claymore</li><li>Excalibur</li><li>Masamune</li><li>Gigas Sword</li><li><a href=\"/dragon-buster/3030-12337/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-12337\">Dragon Buster</a></li><li>Mana Sword</li></ol><h4><a href=\"/spear/3055-573/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-573\">Spear</a></h4><p>The spear is given to the hero by Sage Luka of the Water Palace.

Pressing left and right on the D-pad will rotate the ring, while pressing up and down will switch between different menu rings, which cover the player's inventory, a character's spells, weapons, and game options. This unique radial menu system allows quick selection of items and a minimal interruption in the real time combat.</p><h2>Development</h2><h3>SNES Disc Drive</h3><p>Until the project was canceled, Secret of Mana being developed to come out with the launch of the <a href=\"/snes/3045-9/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-9\">SNES</a> CD add-on. When the add-on was canceled, the game lost approximately 40% of its original content and the graphics were reduced to accommodate a standard cartridge. Examples of unused game portions include staircases that lead to nowhere and doors that are unreachable. Additionally, some parts of the game can be buggy at times due to the alteration.</p><h3>Full Channel Music</h3><p>The <a href=\"/snes/3045-9/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-9\">SNES</a> audio processor is only capable of producing eight sounds at once. Many songs in Secret of Mana using seven to eight channels. This highly unusual use of all audio channels allows the music to be richer, but requires the game to drop channels of music when producing sound effects. Depending on how the player perceives it, this could range from not noticeable to jarring and annoying.</p><h3>English localization</h3><p>The English translation for Secret of Mana was hampered for multiple reasons. First, in an effort not to miss the 1993 holiday season, the English translation was completed in only 30 days. This is compared to the many months usually afforded to English localization efforts.</p><p>Secondly, the English release of Secret of Mana uses a fixed-width font to display gameplay text. This choice of font greatly limits the available space to display text. Accoring to the translator of the game, <a href=\"/ted-woolsey/3040-50831/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-50831\">Ted Woolsey</a>, a large portion of the game's script was cut from the English release due to these space limitations and the lack of sequential text. Many conversations are cut down to their bare minimum.</p><p>A rom hack, <a href=\"http://www.romhacking.net/hacks/18/\" rel=\"nofollow\">FuSoYa\u2019s Niche's Secret of Mana Variable Width Font Edition</a>, was released that brings variable width fonts to the game and uses the extra room to expand the dialogue. This expanded dialogue, however, is fan made, and does not come from the Japanese release, as sometimes is thought.</p><h3>Graphics</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1735/545686-10.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-545686\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.86839666357739\" data-width=\"1079\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1079px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:86.8%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1735/545686-10.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-545686\"><img alt=\"\"Mode 7\" graphics show the overworld of Secret of Mana\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1735/545686-10.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1735/545686-10.jpg 1079w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/1735/545686-10.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1735/545686-10.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1735/545686-10.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\"Mode 7\" graphics show the overworld of Secret of Mana</figcaption></figure><p>The graphics of Secret of Mana place the characters within the surroundings to the point where the colors portray them as part of the world, as opposed to standing out while on it.

Her home planet is being taken over by an evil monster called \"Pimpetrator \" and her people need help to get rid of him before they are all cast into slavery. So she sets off to our heroes' home planet to find someone to help. Our protaganist, Buck, starts off as a taxi driver in a sex-obsessed city. He stumbles upon a space ship after breaking into a police compound. Using this ship, he aims to make his way to Lula's planet to fight the Pimpetrator.</p><h2>Graphics</h2><p>For much of the game, the graphic standard was pre-rendered 3D animation. Environments and characters would interract with each other quite fluidly, however looped animations had a habbit of looking rather repetative very quickly.</p><p>There are some Direct X based 3D elements to the game however. During flight sequences there will be moments when the ship will be attacked by Pirates. At these points the player can enter a Wing-Commander styled gameplay sequence where 3D (Polygon Based) ships will attack.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Gameplay is incredibly varied in this game for such a short story.</p><p>There are four different modes on which the game prides itself on.</p><p>First is an adventure mode, which could also be refferred to as the \"story mode\". Only in this mode the story unfolds and the the player must navigate Buck through areas, find buttons, people, debris and so on. At the start of the game the player finds an upgradable ship called \"The Tit\". For this ship the player can also emply staff members to fly the ship, handle combat, work the sick bay, and work as gigolos/prostitutes. This mode is always of a side scrolling nature and is controlled in a similar way to that of most side scollers, a left mouse click will move the player to an area, and right mouse click changes interration mode (Touch, Use, Talk etc). It is also possible for players to fly between planets to further the story.</p><p>The Second mode is Business Management. This mode has no effect on story but is included as something to occupy the players' time. This mode consists of a large room. In this room are smaller rooms filled with gigolos and prostitutes (one per room), and the main premise is that, when the players' ship has landed on a planet, the inhabitants will pay for time with these gigolos. The mode itself has some elements one wouldnt expect however. For example, it features the ability to fully customize the rooms (Like The Sims, Theme Hospital) and it also has statistics on cleanliness, diseased rooms and satisfaction of both staff and customers. This mode is of an isometric nature.</p><p>The Third mode is a full 3D mode. This mode occours when Prates attack the ship in-between space flight to and from planets. The mode itself is very basic, ships will fly toward the camera (1st person turret on ship) and will shoot. The damage incurred to the player is not immediately visible, and can only be guaged when the player exits the mode. The player simply has to click and hold the left mouse button to fire the gun to destroy enemies.</p><p>The final fourth mode is a foreplay simulator. When the player accesses this mode from a staff members profile (by clicking on them), a pre rendered Full Motion Video (FMV) appears. However, unlike most FMV's, this FMV has small boxes renered over it. Clicking inside of these boxes, not only at the correct time, but in the correct box, gives points. In the FMV the girl is usually sitting in a provocative pose, for example, with her legs open toward the player. The boxes are usually rendered on her breasts, crotch and mouth. Each box has a certain score attatched to it based on a girls likes, for example if a girl likes being kissed, using a kiss tool on her mouth will offer max points, however, repeating this over and over decreases points from that area, and the player must try something new.</p><p>Much like the Adventure mode, the player can cycle through \"tools\" to use on the girl with the right mouse button. These range from a tongue and a hand, to sex toys. If the player reaches a maximum amount of points within a pre-set time limit, they are treated to a FMV of the players character and the girl having intercourse.</p>", "expected_release_day": null, "expected_release_month": null, "expected_release_quarter": null, "expected_release_year": 1999, "guid": "3030-19700", "id": 19700, "image": {"icon_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/721457-lula_2___sexy_galaxy_wet_attack.jpg", "medium_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_medium/721457-lula_2___sexy_galaxy_wet_attack.jpg", "screen_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/screen_medium/721457-lula_2___sexy_galaxy_wet_attack.jpg", "screen_large_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/screen_kubrick/721457-lula_2___sexy_galaxy_wet_attack.jpg", "small_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_small/721457-lula_2___sexy_galaxy_wet_attack.jpg", "super_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_large/721457-lula_2___sexy_galaxy_wet_attack.jpg", "thumb_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_avatar/721457-lula_2___sexy_galaxy_wet_attack.jpg", "tiny_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_mini/721457-lula_2___sexy_galaxy_wet_attack.jpg", "original_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/721457-lula_2___sexy_galaxy_wet_attack.jpg", "image_tags": "All Images,Box Art"}, "image_tags": [{"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-19700/?filter=image_tag%3AAll+Images", "name": "All Images", "total": 4}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-19700/?filter=image_tag%3ABox+Art", "name": "Box Art", "total": 1}], "name": "Wet Attack: The Empire Cums Back", "number_of_user_reviews": 0, "original_game_rating": null, "original_release_date": null, "platforms": [{"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-94/", "id": 94, "name": "PC", "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/", "abbreviation": "PC"}], "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/wet-attack-the-empire-cums-back/3030-19700/"}, {"aliases": null, "api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-19888/", "date_added": "2008-04-01 16:50:31", "date_last_updated": "2019-06-25 03:12:00", "deck": "F-19 Stealth Fighter was a flight simulator featuring multiple types of jets, selectable weapon payloads, and a unique inter-mission rating scale that could see you either surrounded by friends or alone at a bar.", "description": "<p>Released in 1990, F-19 Stealth Fighter was flight simulator that allowed the player to take control of various types of jets (including the titular F-19) to accomplish a variety of missions.

It was also the first Ace Combat game to include characters with extensive voice acting, and with it, more wingmen giving the series its trademark sense of camaraderie.</p><p>Unfortunately, due to development costs, most of these groundbreaking elements would be cut out of the international release of the game, cutting the game size down to one CD and opting for one singular path of the story, and the voice work and other characters all but removed.

At the end of each level, the music changes and players fight an end boss. Once the player defeats the boss, the level ends (giving player an end bonus while refilling their health and Special Attack amount).</p><p>Players earn score by defeating enemies and picking up money items. They also earn a bonus at the end of the level, composed of a clear bonus (of 20,000 points), time bonus (100 points for each second remaining), and level bonus (10,000 points for each difficulty above Easy). At the end of the game, they also earn 1,000 points for each life remaining (multiplied by the difficulty).</p><p>Each player starts with three lives, and can get <a href=\"/extra-life/3015-1806/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1806\">extra lives</a> by either reaching certain score thresholds or picking up rare 1UP items. When the player's health meter is fully depleted (or the timer is fully depleted), he/she loses a life. If he/she has any lives remaining, he/she <a href=\"/respawn/3015-989/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-989\">respawns</a> from the top of the screen, knocking down all enemies on the field. If all lives are lost, then the player can input a name for the <a href=\"/high-score/3015-260/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-260\">high scores</a> list (if they have a valid score) and is given the option of using up a <a href=\"/continue/3015-635/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-635\">continue</a> (giving the player three lives and removing all of his/her score). Each player starts with three continues, and if the player has no continues or lives remaining, then he/she gets a <a href=\"/game-over/3015-372/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-372\">game over</a>.</p><h3>Basic Controls and Attacks</h3><p>Players move around the screen using the D-Pad and jump around using the Jump Button (defaulted to the C Button). Pressing the basic Attack Button (defaulted to the B button) causes the player character to punch enemies, while pressing it repeatedly produces a combo of damaging punches and kicks. Pressing the Attack Button while jumping causes the player character to perform a jump kick, knocking down enemies in his/her path.</p><p>Pressing both Jump and Attack buttons simultaneously causes the player character to perform a Rear Attack, which knocks back enemies behind him/her.</p><h3>Special Attacks</h3><p>When the player has at least one Special Attacks available (shown by the health meter as the S symbol), they can press the Special Attack Button (defaulted to the A button) at an opportune time to stop the fight as the screen quickly scrolls left to show a police car arriving at the scene. The passenger officer then helps the protagonists by firing either a <a href=\"/napalm/3055-1776/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1776\">Napalm</a> Missile (if player 1 activates the attack) or Rocket-Propelled <a href=\"/grenade/3055-111/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-111\">Grenades</a> (if player 2 activates the attack).</p><p>Both attacks are the same, however, as they deal heavy damage to all enemies on the screen (while knocking them down). Each player starts with one Special Attack, which can only be replenished by completing a level or respawning. They can, however, earn extra Special Attacks by finding a special item (a toy police car) at two points of the game. In the final stage (Round 8), Special Attacks are completely disabled.</p><h3>Grab Attacks</h3><p>By approaching enemies close enough (and not getting attacked), players automatically grab enemies from either the front or the back. After a short amount of time, they automatically release the enemy. By pressing the Jump button, they perform a shoulder vault, alternating between Front Grab and Back Grab positions.</p><p>In the Front Grab position, players can tap the Attack button to perform a fury combo and use the Attack button while holding the opposite direction on the d-pad to throw the enemy behind him/her. In the Back Grab position, players can use the Attack button to perform a powerful Backdrop suplex.</p><p>Players can also work together by grabbing each other and performing special team attacks. By holding the opposite direction on the d-pad and pressing the Attack button, the grabbing player throws his/her partner, who performs a flying kick. By pressing the Jump button, the grabbing player flips over his/her partner, performing a flying kick.</p><h2>Weapons and Bonus Items</h2><h3>Weapons</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3816/462906-sora5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-462906\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3816/462906-sora5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-462906\"><img alt=\"Adam attacking with a Baseball Bat.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3816/462906-sora5.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3816/462906-sora5.jpg 640w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3816/462906-sora5.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3816/462906-sora5.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Adam attacking with a Baseball Bat.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3816/462906-sora5.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3816/462906-sora5.jpg 640w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3816/462906-sora5.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3816/462906-sora5.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Adam attacking with a Baseball Bat.</figcaption></figure><p>Throughout the game, players can find weapons either dropped by enemies or by destroying certain objects (such as barrels, crates, and traffic cones). Players can equip a weapon by standing over it and pressing the Attack button. However, they can only pick up one weapon at a time, and picking up another weapon causes the player to drop the other weapon. The player also drops the weapon when he is knocked down. Dropped weapons disappear over time.</p><ul><li><a href=\"/bottle/3055-133/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-133\"><b>Bottle</b></a> - Powerful close-range attack.</li><li><a href=\"/knife/3055-295/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-295\"><b>Knife</b></a> - Powerful close-range attack, which can also be thrown at far enemies.</li><li><a href=\"/lead-pipe/3055-150/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-150\"><b>Lead Pipe</b></a> - Slow to attack, but powerful with a long range.</li><li><a href=\"/baseball-bat/3055-39/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-39\"><b>Baseball Bat</b></a> - Slow to attack, but powerful with a long range.</li><li><b>Pepper Shaker</b> - A throwable weapon that creates a puff of pepper smoke, stunning enemies into a sneezing fit.</li></ul><h3>Bonus Items</h3><p>Alongside the five weapons, there are six items located throughout the game which give the player health (or other goodies) or adds to the player's score. They are found by destroying objects (the same type of objects used to hold weapons) and are picked up using the Attack button. (Unlike picking up weapons, picking up items does not drop the player's current weapon)</p><ul><li><a href=\"/apple/3055-138/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-138\"><b>Apple</b></a> - Common item that restores about a quarter of the player's health bar.</li><li><a href=\"/meat/3055-267/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-267\"><b>Beef</b></a> - Uncommon item that restores the player's entire health bar.

In order to progress to the next screen, they must clear out all enemies on the field. There are five types of punks to fight and, unlike the game's sequels, no names are shown for enemies on the game screen.</p><ul><li><p><b>Garcia</b> - The standard type of punks (in either blue, green, or red denim clothing), who primarily attacks with punches and kicks (and sometimes equipped weapons). He can also grab players from the back, in which players can perform a two-part attack (using the Attack button twice) in which the player kicks enemies in front of him/her and counter-throw the grabbing punk. Some of the Garcia punks also run around with a knife, charging at players relentlessly.</p></li><li><p><b>Y. Signal</b> - Usually shown from the back (in either yellow, purple, or green clothing). He grab players from the front and throws them foward. Some of the Y. Signal punks can also perform a sliding kick, which is difficult to dodge.</p></li><li><p><b>Nora</b> - Shown as a female dominatrix (in either red, black, or white clothing), who attacks with a long-ranged whip. Some of the Nora punks lay on the ground when players knock her down, making them temporarily invulnerable.</p></li><li><p><b>Haku-Oh</b> - A trained warrior shown in gray, red, or black kung fu gear, Haku-Oh jumps around and performs long-ranged jumping kicks at players.</p></li><li><p><b>Jack</b> - An uncommon enemy with spiked clown hair (and red, gray, or black clothing), Jack hops around juggling either axes or torches (which damage players that get too close). After some time, they throw the axes/torches ahead of them (causing damage to players in the way) and obtain more axes/torches.</p></li></ul><h3>Bosses</h3><p>At the end of each level (with the exception of Round 7), players must fight one boss to continue to the next level. In some occasions (especially if two players are playing at the same time), players fight two of the same boss at the same time. At later levels, some bosses re-appear as mid-bosses. In Round 8, players must face all six bosses consecutively (without the ease of Special Attacks). Unlike the game's sequels, no names are shown for enemies on the game screen.</p><ul><li><p><a href=\"/antonio/3005-14775/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-14775\"><b>Antonio</b></a> - A large punk (wearing denim clothing) holding a large <a href=\"/boomerang/3055-76/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-76\">boomerang</a>. Along with kicking players in front of him, he throws his boomerang around (which returns to him after being thrown). He is the main boss of Round 1.</p></li><li><p><b>Souther</b> - Wearing a red-sleeved jacket and claw-mounted gloves, he attacks with unavoidable and powerful slash attacks. He is the main boss of Round 2.</p></li><li><p><a href=\"/abadede/3005-14317/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-14317\"><b>Abadede</b></a> - A former pro-wrestler, he primarily attacks with powerful charging punches. He can also perform a body slam if players are close enough. He is the main boss of Round 3.</p></li><li><p><b>Bongo</b> - A fat man in suspenders who charges players while breathing fire from his mouth. Attempting to perform a Backdrop attack on Bongo causes him to fall on the player, causing damage to that player. He is the main boss of Round 4.</p></li><li><p><a href=\"/mona-lisa/3005-14404/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-14404\"><b>Mona &amp; Lisa</b></a> - Japanese twins (with an appearance identical to Blaze) who fight together, performing jump kicks, forward throws, and Backdrop attacks. They are the main bosses of Round 5.</p></li><li><p><a href=\"/mr-x/3005-14310/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-14310\"><b>Mr. X</b></a> - The final boss of the game. Armed with a <a href=\"/machine-gun/3055-608/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-608\">machine gun</a>, he alternates between firing the gun (spreading bullets around the screen) and performing a powerful charging rifle butt.</p></li></ul><h2>Endings</h2><p>Streets of Rage is the first brawler to feature <a href=\"/multiple-endings/3015-27/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-27\">multiple endings</a>, which is determined by both players' choices at the end of the game. Before the fight boss fight, Mr. X asks the players if they want to be his right-hand man. This has one of three choices:</p><ul><li><p>If all players say \"Yes\", then Mr. X tests them by sending them down a trapdoor, resetting the game back to Round 6.</p></li><li><p>If all players say \"No\", then they fight Mr. X and get the Good Ending, in which they celebrate after bringing justice.</p></li><li><p>If one player says \"Yes\" and the other says \"No\", then both players fight in a duel. Once a player loses all his/her lives, Mr. X then asks the victor if he/she wants to join his organization. If the player says \"Yes\", then Mr. X tests him/her by sending him/her down a trapdoor, resetting the game back to Round 6. If the player says \"No\", then the player fights Mr. X and gets the Bad Ending, in which the player takes over the corrupt organization.</p></li></ul>", "expected_release_day": 2,

These ruins are a beacon of hope for the remaining colonists, emerging in the form of a mysterious Vault that is said to contain vast stores of alien technology that - if found - would make the discoverers rich and powerful beyond human imagination.

But if a player \"grinds\" in a area that is too far below his/her own level they will only gain 1 XP per enemy. The original leveling was <a href=\"../../level-cap/92-3025/\" rel=\"nofollow\">capped</a> at 50. The third DLC pack, <a href=\"reviews/?review_id=265\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Secret Armory of General Knoxx</a>, increased the cap to 61 - which was eventually changed to 69 in a free patch for everyone. With each new level, players may assign points to character attributes and skills. Upon reaching level five, each class will gain access to a class-specific skill (e.g. Roland's turret or Mordecai's Bloodwing). Moving forward from level five, players may progress through their skill trees choosing one of three paths to further enhance existing skills, and gain access to new ones. A max level character will have earned 46 points for spending in the skill tree -- 1 to gain access to the action skill and 45 to place as the player chooses among other skills.</p><h3>Weapon Proficiency</h3><p>In addition to skill advancement chosen by the player upon leveling, weapons skills are also advanced based on usage. These weapon skills give bonuses to reload time, stability, damage, rate of fire, cool-down rate and accuracy, depending on which weapon that the player is using.</p><h3>Character Customization</h3><p>Aesthetic customization is present, although it is limited to setting armor and clothing colors. The base appearance of characters is static; all Berserkers will appear as Brick and all Hunters will appear as Mordecai, for example. Of course, players will also see the unique models of any guns that may be equipped.</p><h3>Loot</h3><p>The game has garnered comparisons to <a href=\"../../diablo/61-5985/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Diablo</a> for its inclusion of a plethora of procedurally-generated weapons. Some enemies will drop <a href=\"../../random-loot/92-365/\" rel=\"nofollow\">loot</a>. In true medieval RPG fashion, <a href=\"../../treasure-chest/93-517/\" rel=\"nofollow\">treasure chests</a> also appear throughout the world, albeit in more appropriate forms. In addition to guns, players will happen upon <a href=\"../../grenade/93-111/\" rel=\"nofollow\">grenade</a> mods, <a href=\"../../shield-regeneration/92-2349/\" rel=\"nofollow\">shields</a>, artifacts, and class mods which will grant a boost to the character's skills. <a href=\"../../vending-machine/93-200/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vending machines</a> are available to facilitate the buying and selling of loot. When players look at a dropped piece of loot, a box pops up providing vital information about that item. Loot is also color-coded based on how common it is a la Diablo, the color coding rarity scheme is as follows, from least to greatest: White, Green, Blue, Purple, Yellow, Orange, Dark Orange, Pearl. (The Pearlescent color is a very light shade of blue, not to be confused with White guns).</p><h3>Quests</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3661/1670743-borderlands_2010_12_30_06_30_47_91.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1670743\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3661/1670743-borderlands_2010_12_30_06_30_47_91.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1670743\"><img alt=\"A large number of quests revolve around audio-logs.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3661/1670743-borderlands_2010_12_30_06_30_47_91.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3661/1670743-borderlands_2010_12_30_06_30_47_91.jpg 1280w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/3661/1670743-borderlands_2010_12_30_06_30_47_91.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3661/1670743-borderlands_2010_12_30_06_30_47_91.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"A large number of quests revolve around audio-logs.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3661/1670743-borderlands_2010_12_30_06_30_47_91.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3661/1670743-borderlands_2010_12_30_06_30_47_91.jpg 1280w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/3661/1670743-borderlands_2010_12_30_06_30_47_91.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3661/1670743-borderlands_2010_12_30_06_30_47_91.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>A large number of quests revolve around audio-logs.</figcaption></figure><p>The game contains 160 quests. These are composed of 30 quests in the mainline story and 130 <a href=\"../../side-quests/92-338/\" rel=\"nofollow\">side quests</a>. Most quests will be taken from <a href=\"../../non-player-character/92-967/\" rel=\"nofollow\">NPCs</a> and bounty boards in the games various towns and settlements. In addition to quests, the game includes repeatable scenarios complete with bosses that may be farmed for loot and experience.</p><p>Once the main storyline quests are complete, there is an option to <a href=\"/new-game-plus/3015-150/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-150\">New Game +</a> the game with another playthrough, resulting in tougher enemies and a reset of all quests to higher level, awarding more experience points (though character progression and weapons remain).</p><h3>Co-op</h3><p>Borderlands features <a href=\"../../4-player-co-op/92-2563/\" rel=\"nofollow\">four-player co-op</a> online and two-player <a href=\"../../split-screen-multiplayer/92-322/\" rel=\"nofollow\">local co-op</a> in the console versions. The co-op allows for a persistent character to hop from one co-op game to another while keeping all the equipment and experience earned in a previous game. Progress in quests and the storyline, however, is confined to the game world of the player hosting the game. Difficulty scales based on the number of player characters participating. Play with more players and more enemies will spawn in the world. Money and experience rewarded for kills are divided evenly amongst players. Loot and ammo, however, belongs to whoever gets there first.</p><p>The game also includes player versus player combat. In co-op, players can also challenge each other to a duel. One player melees another, and if they melee back a dome will form around them and they can battle it out. In addition, arenas can be found around the world where players can fight each other.</p><p>Some players have figured out how to hack the loot system in borderlands, as some players may find while online. The best example of this is the Omega Rose shield. It makes the player nearly invincible with a high shield rating well above what any other shield will provide. It is not in the game, players have hacked the loot system to make the shield. With the release of the very difficult add-on of the Armory of General Knoxx, this shield has been showing up more as with even a high level and top of the line shield, death can come very quickly.</p><h3>Weapons</h3><p>One of the big draws of Borderlands is the promise of millions of guns that are all unique, generated procedurally. During the <a href=\"../../e3-2008/92-3499/\" rel=\"nofollow\">E3 2008</a> gameplay <a href=\"../../demo/92-1641/\" rel=\"nofollow\">demo</a>, Gearbox stated that each of the game's weapons manufacturers have rules and materials that define what\u2019s available for them to use to create the weapons. The developers of Borderlands created a program that generates weapons based on a set of rules. According to Game Informer, <a href=\"../../randy-pitchford/72-4430/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Randy Pitchford</a> reported that the last weapon count for the game was an astronomical 17,750,000.</p><h3>Traversing the Landscape</h3><p>Designated spawn points throughout the world allow players to summon a vehicle, otherwise known as \" <a href=\"../../catch-a-ride/92-4663/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Catch-A-Ride</a>!\". Players will be able to customize various vehicles with one of two different weapons ( <a href=\"../../rocket-launcher/93-211/\" rel=\"nofollow\">rocket launcher</a> or <a href=\"../../machine-gun/93-608/\" rel=\"nofollow\">machine gun</a>) and paint jobs. This is one of two preferred traveling methods the other being the now familiar <a href=\"../../fast-travel/92-676/\" rel=\"nofollow\">fast travel</a> system that allows for instant <a href=\"../../teleportation/92-8/\" rel=\"nofollow\">teleporting</a> between locations once they have been unlocked. Players will gain access to vehicles relatively early in the game with the fast travel system opening up later.</p><h3>Challenges</h3><p>In addition to <a href=\"../../achievements/92-29/\" rel=\"nofollow\">achievements</a> and trophies, Borderlands has an in-game <a href=\"../../challenges/92-1925/\" rel=\"nofollow\">challenge</a> system. The challenges are structured like achievements or trophies; however, they are separate from those systems and reward characters with experience upon completion.</p><h3>Death</h3><p>Borderlands utilizes the <a href=\"../../down-but-not-out/92-4335/\" rel=\"nofollow\">down but not out</a> concept. When <a href=\"../../health/92-130/\" rel=\"nofollow\">health</a> reaches zero, players will be immobilized and slowly \"bleed out\" as the screen loses contrast; however, weapons can still be fired. Teammates have the ability to revive fallen allies. If players achieve a kill in this wounded state, a \"second wind\" will be awarded, this will instantly revive the character with full shields. However, if a character cannot be revived, they will spawn at the nearest New-U station for a fee. The fee is a percentage of the player's total cash on hand. The percentage for respawning at a New-U station is between 10% and 14.3% averaging at 14.29%. Players can never go into negative money, so if a player has no money the fee is waived.</p><h2>Skills</h2><h3>Action skills</h3><p>Each character has only one single Action Skill, which is earned at level 5. This is the first skill to be learned and all the others derive from it. Further developing skills will also improve that action skill. All action skills are temporary.</p><ul><li><b>Mordecai</b> - Mordecai's action skill allows him to unleash a bird of prey called Bloodwing unto his enemies.</li><li><b>Lilith</b> - Lilith's action skill is the Phasewalk. When using it, she becomes temporarily invisible and moves faster as well as damages enemies within the area the skill is activated.</li><li><b>Roland</b> - Roland's action skill deploys a Scorpio Turret, which attacks enemies while providing cover, since the base of the turret projects an energy shield towards the area of fire.</li><li><b>Brick</b> - Brick's action skill makes him go Berserk. While under its effect, Brick's vision becomes clouded with blood, he laughs frantically, puts away his firearms uses his fists to pummel through enemies. His melee damage is significantly increased, he takes a lot less damage from any sort of attacks, and even regenerates health during battle.</li></ul><h3>Skill trees</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1565660-mordecai.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1565660\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.68\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:68.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1565660-mordecai.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1565660\"><img alt=\"Mordecai's Skill Tree.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/62890/1565660-mordecai.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1565660-mordecai.jpg 600w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/62890/1565660-mordecai.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/62890/1565660-mordecai.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Mordecai's Skill Tree.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/62890/1565660-mordecai.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1565660-mordecai.jpg 600w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/62890/1565660-mordecai.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/62890/1565660-mordecai.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Mordecai's Skill Tree.</figcaption></figure><p>Each class has three different groups of skills within his/her tree skill, which in turn are divided into 4 sub-groups each.

found themselves with little left to do. They made a plea to <a href=\"../../randall-s-pitchford-ii/72-4430/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Randy Pitchford</a> and others to develop a distinctive graphical style more closely mirroring the style of their <a href=\"../../concept-art/92-3763/\" rel=\"nofollow\">concept artwork</a>. There was some skepticism over making such a large change at such a late stage in development. The art team was asked to develop a prototype of this new art style without the knowledge of Pitchford. When the prototype was shown, it was decided that this distinctive new art style was a must for the final game. These events led to the retooling of Borderlands into what we have today.</p><p>Pitchford was quoted as saying that the PC version \"destroys\" the consoles in terms of graphics. However, the PC version shipped with a host of issues such as crashes, quests not finishing properly, and buggy netcode.</p><h2>Pandora's Geography</h2><p>There are six main areas in the game, those being:</p><ul><li><b>Arid Badlands</b></li><li><b>Dahl Headlands</b></li><li><b>New Haven</b></li><li><b>Rust Commons West</b></li><li><b>Rust Commons East</b></li><li><b>Salt Flats</b></li></ul><p>However, a lot of other smaller areas can be accessed via the main ones. </p><p>The following is a list of all the sectors in alphabetical list of all sub-sectors that can be found in Borderlands, and where they can be accessed from.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><h3>From the Arid Badlands</h3><ul><li>Arid Hills</li><li>Dahl Headlands (main area)</li><li>Fyrestone

of Dr. Ned, was released on November 24th, 2009 for <a href=\"../../xbox-360/60-20/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Xbox 360</a>, and <a href=\"../../playstation-3/60-35/\" rel=\"nofollow\">PlayStation 3,</a> priced at 800 Microsoft Points and $9.99 respectively, while the PC version came out on December 9th, 2009, costing $9.99 as well. Predictably, the story of the DLC (which is implied to be something the Narrator made up) involves the vault hunters traveling to a remote island, the home of one <a href=\"/dr-ned/3005-13494/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-13494\">Dr. Ned</a>, who has unleashed an army of undead abominations upon the good people who live there. The island includes new quests, new dungeons, a few new areas to explore, new enemies to kill, and has around 4-6 hours of new content to explore. The expansion allows players to visit a Jakobs Weapons Factory, and learn more about the weapon manufacturers, as well as what went wrong with the island and cause it to be overrun by zombies in the first place. Players can teleport to the island from a New-U station, as long as they are level 10 or above, and the area difficulty will scale accordingly.</p><h3>Mad Moxxi's Underdome Riot</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/1213893-dlc2_launch_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1213893\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/1213893-dlc2_launch_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1213893\"><img alt=\"Roland fights off waves of enemies.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/33529/1213893-dlc2_launch_1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1213893-dlc2_launch_1.jpg 1024w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/3/33529/1213893-dlc2_launch_1.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/1213893-dlc2_launch_1.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/33529/1213893-dlc2_launch_1.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Roland fights off waves of enemies.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/33529/1213893-dlc2_launch_1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1213893-dlc2_launch_1.jpg 1024w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/3/33529/1213893-dlc2_launch_1.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/1213893-dlc2_launch_1.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/33529/1213893-dlc2_launch_1.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Roland fights off waves of enemies.</figcaption></figure><p>The second DLC for Borderlands, titled Mad Moxxi' s Underdome Riot, was released on December 29th, 2009 for Xbox 360, and January 7th, 2010 for PS3 and PC. The central premise for this DLC is a type of <a href=\"../../horde/92-3021/\" rel=\"nofollow\">horde mode</a>, which has the player(s) participating in arena tournaments hosted by <a href=\"../../mad-moxxi/94-13441/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mad Moxxi</a>. Players battle against waves of enemies whilst subject to \"Moxxi's Maxims,\" which are rules that will slightly alter the gameplay (for instance providing a bonus to grenade damage). There are two main types of tournaments featured; medium-length tournaments that will take approximately an hour to complete, and a hardcore tournament lasting up to 6 hours that must be completed in one sitting. Players are given three arenas to fight in. The DLC also includes a bank to store items, as well as two skill points as a quest reward. Unlike the main game and other expansions, players do not gain experience, weapon proficiency, weapons, or money from killing enemies. Weapons only appear at the end of every boss wave (fifth wave) in the round.</p><h3>The Secret Armory of General Knoxx</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/1258216-mech_1282010_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1258216\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/1258216-mech_1282010_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1258216\"><img alt=\"Mordecai and Lilith face off against General Knoxx.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/1258216-mech_1282010_2.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1258216-mech_1282010_2.jpg 1024w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/7465/1258216-mech_1282010_2.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7465/1258216-mech_1282010_2.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/1258216-mech_1282010_2.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Mordecai and Lilith face off against General Knoxx.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/1258216-mech_1282010_2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1258216-mech_1282010_2.jpg 1024w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/7465/1258216-mech_1282010_2.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7465/1258216-mech_1282010_2.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/1258216-mech_1282010_2.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Mordecai and Lilith face off against General Knoxx.</figcaption></figure><p>The third DLC for Borderlands, ostensibly taking place after the conclusion of the main storyline, takes players to a new area of Pandora on a quest to discover the titular armory belonging to <a href=\"../../general-knoxx/94-14034/\" rel=\"nofollow\">General Knoxx</a>, who is leading the Crimson Lance on Pandora.

This ten dollar add-on sees players siding with the Hyperion Corporation, putting their past differences aside, and teaming up against a revolution of homicidal Claptraps. Their leader is an expert in kung-fu, only known as the Ninja Assassin Claptrap. 2K President Christoph Hartmann says that 'Robot Revolution' is the \"perfect bookend to the original game\". \"Revolution\" was released September 28, 2010.</p><p>In total, 'Robot Revolution' extends the game by adding: 20 new missions, original boss battles, waves of homicidal Claptraps, well-armed Hyperion soldiers, and local creatures that have been Claptrap-ified - including crab-traps, rakk-traps and skag-trapps. CEO Randy Pitchford has confirmed that there will be no level cap increase for the game, but players will be awarded 10 additional skill tree points.</p><p>At Gearbox's panel during PAX Prime 2010, Randy Pitchford made the announcement that coinciding with the release of Claptrap's New Robot Revolution, they would be releasing a title update that would boost the level cap by 8 points to a grand total of 69 for those who had purchased the General Knox DLC.</p><p><a href=\"/darkside-game-studios/3010-7305/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-7305\">Darkside Game</a> Studios developed this expansion with some help from Gearbox.

It functions primarily as a third-person shooter with an <a href=\"/over-the-shoulder/3015-2621/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2621\">over-the-shoulder</a> perspective, only players cannot simultaneously move and shoot. This then gives the game a more methodical feel that prioritises accuracy and crowd management rather than commonly hunkering behind cover or running &amp; gunning. Though while there is in fact a cover system, it is relatively rudimentary and is only accessible at specific segments -- most notably during when enemies that can shoot back such as Soldier Majini are introduced. When available, players can pop-out to fire, but cannot shimmy along nor dive between different pieces of cover.</p><p>For as much as RE5 resembles RE4, it still nonetheless carves out its own identity by way of its faster pace and more action-orientated focus. Puzzles have been near-completely removed, and RE5 has adopted a more modern shooter control scheme that by default has players aim with L1/LB and shoot with R1/RB. Characters can now slowly strafe left or right as well, though amongst the four variable control schemes exists the 'Classic' Type D, which has RE5 control much like RE4. However that also includes removing the player's ability to strafe. A basic map in the top right corner of the screen can be displayed by pressing R2/RT. It won't disclose the information of enemy locations, but will at least visualise the blueprint-like design of the area.</p><p>The story is now told almost-exclusively via in-game cutscenes this time around, though nearing the later segments there are still a number of Files (diaries, memos ect.) that shed light on the series' backstory and mythos.</p><p>The most notary change from RE4 is the addition of a secondary character that persists throughout the whole game, in both single-player and cooperative formats.

Long gone is the tetris-like inventory management of Resident Evil 4, and in its stead is a new format that is presented as a grid made up of nine squares -- each of which can hold any type of weapon or item. Players press triangle/Y to bring up their inventory, where they can then choose to move around their items into whichever square they desire. However inventory management is done in real time, and players cannot move whilst in their inventory leaving them potentially vulnerable to attack. To compensate, players can now once again reload their weapons via their inventory screen--by moving ammo towards the hypothetical weapon square--as opposed to only being able to do so manually like in RE4. Due to the animation-priority concerning certain actions, this allows players to reload their weapons or move items around while the character is climbing a ladder or opening a door for example. The speed with which the inventory menu can be opened &amp; closed attributes to this factor also.</p><p>Another benefit is with the use of the d-pad players can select between whatever items they have in the top, left, right, and bottom squares. This thusly allows players to switch between their weapons in real time.</p><p>There is no longer a mysterious merchant by which players buy and upgrade their weapons. Instead there is a HUB that the player can use to store unwanted weaponry or ammunition and so forth, and can then use their accumulated gold from killing enemies to potentially buy new weapons or upgrade their current ones. Though not all weapons are available for purchase; some are unlocked as the story progresses, while others are made available once other certain weapons have been fully upgraded. Treasures can once again be collected through the game, be they hidden within the environment or dropped by a powerful enemy, which can be sold in the HUB for additional cash. Treasures cannot be combined like in RE4 for an increase in value, however.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2637075-res5_inventory.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2637075\" data-ratio=\"0.62588235294118\" data-width=\"425\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 425px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.6%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2637075-res5_inventory.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2637075\"><img alt=\"The Inventory &amp; Cooperative HUB\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2637075-res5_inventory.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2637075-res5_inventory.jpg 425w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2637075-res5_inventory.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Inventory &amp; Cooperative HUB\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2637075-res5_inventory.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2637075-res5_inventory.jpg 425w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2637075-res5_inventory.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Inventory &amp; Cooperative HUB</figcaption></figure><p>Players are sent to the HUB whenever they re-enter the story should they have quitted earlier, in-between story chapters, and even when they die. Whatever treasures/weapons/ammunition the player may have collected (or used up, in the case of ammunition) before reaching a hard checkpoint will still persist in the player's inventory when they are sent back to the HUB. Players can also access it via the game's main menu as well.</p><h3>Health &amp; Healing Items</h3><p>A character's health is now again represented as 3/4's of a circle; whence damaged, the health of the circle will deplete and change color the more health is lost. A character's extent of health is static and cannot be upgraded with yellow herbs anymore, though there are items that can be equipped to reduce damage.</p><p>While yellow herbs are no longer available, green and red still persist and can be combined to increase their effectiveness. A list of herbs and their effectiveness is as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>Green Herb</strong> - On its own will heal roughly 25% of health.</li><li><strong>Green + Green Herb</strong> - Mixed will now health roughly 50% of health.</li><li><strong>Green + Red Herb</strong> - Mixed will heal the player character fully.</li><li><strong>Red Herb</strong> - On its own will do nothing.</li></ul><p>Besides herbs, first aid sprays are available for use and like always will heal the character fully. Eggs can also be found throughout the game in three varieties:</p><ul><li><strong>White</strong> - Roughly heals about 30% of health</li><li><strong>Brown</strong> - Roughly heals about 40% of health</li><li><strong>Gold</strong> - Heals a character fully.</li></ul><p>While they're ordinarily found like any other item, the player will sometimes encounter chickens. If a player scares it enough, be it by aiming or shooting near one, there's a chance it'll lay an egg the player can collect. Snakes also exist within the world (and often like to hide within destructible crates/barrels) that have a chance of dropping an egg whence killed, too.</p><p>When healing with a herb mixture or first aid spray it's beneficial that the characters are close by as it will heal them both -- eggs, however, will not. Though they do at least have the advantage of being stackable, with up to five of a single variety being able to fit into a single inventory square.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2637076-re5_dying.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2637076\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2637076-re5_dying.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2637076\"><img alt=\"Chris, shown to be in the 'Dying' state.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2637076-re5_dying.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2637076-re5_dying.jpg 400w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2637076-re5_dying.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Chris, shown to be in the 'Dying' state.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2637076-re5_dying.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2637076-re5_dying.jpg 400w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2637076-re5_dying.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Chris, shown to be in the 'Dying' state.</figcaption></figure><p>When a character's health gets into the red the player will visually walk with their hand on their hip with a slight decrease in movement speed. Should a character lose all of their health, however, they will go into the Dying state -- represented by the fourth segment of the circle. When in the Dying state players can only slowly limp while what remains of their dying gauge begins to drop; the only way out of it is if the other character can either heal them with a herb/first aid spray, or will otherwise administer a shot of adrenaline to bring them out of it -- a prompt to do so for both actions will appear on the saviour character's screen. The shot will not heal any health, however, and any attack will throw the character back in the Dying state--if not kill them outright--which will continue to drop from whence it was left before the player was pulled out of it.</p><h3>Cooperative Gameplay</h3><p>In-line with the game's bigger emphasis on action, the whole of RE5's story can be played cooperatively for up to two-players. By default player 1 is always Chris Redfield while the second takes control of Sheva Alomar. Though upon completing the game the first player can then choose which character they want to play as. RE5 can be played cooperatively Online, though split-screen and even LAN are available methods also. However there is no drop-in drop-out functionality; whence a new player joins an online game, the game will take both players back to the HUB screen as mentioned before.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2637077-resident-evil-5-screenshot-2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2637077\" data-ratio=\"0.56276150627615\" data-width=\"478\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 478px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2637077-resident-evil-5-screenshot-2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2637077\"><img alt=\"Playable story characters Sheva &amp; Chris\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2637077-resident-evil-5-screenshot-2.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2637077-resident-evil-5-screenshot-2.jpg 478w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2637077-resident-evil-5-screenshot-2.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Playable story characters Sheva &amp; Chris\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2637077-resident-evil-5-screenshot-2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2637077-resident-evil-5-screenshot-2.jpg 478w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2637077-resident-evil-5-screenshot-2.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Playable story characters Sheva &amp; Chris</figcaption></figure><p>Both Chris &amp; Sheva play almost the exact same as one another, and have the same capabilities and can use nearly all of the weapons available in the game, however they each have their own single, exclusive weapon that only they can use. The one major difference between how they each play is their perspective; Chris, like the playable characters of RE4 before him, aims over his right shoulder, whereas Sheva aims over her left. This was done to give the game a more pleasing visual aesthetic in split-screen mode.</p><p>There are a number of times throughout the game where the two characters are forced to split-up. This usually involves Sheva, with the help of Chris, leaping over a gap to reach another part of the environment to collect a key item -- while the other may likely be able to provide cover fire. However since the players are split up, they can no longer heal each other nor bring the other back out of the dying state. Though sequences where characters split-up are short-lived.</p><p>Players are able to trade supplies such as ammunition and healing items (thought not weapons) between each other both in-game and in the HUB. There is also a small series of in-game commands players can give each other. These are: Go, Wait, Come On, and Thanks. Go, Wait, and Thanks are triggered by holding (by default) the circle/B button down, and then choosing from the three commands with the d-pad; Come On is triggered by simply pressing the circle/B button. Though Thanks can also be triggered this way in response to assistance from the other character, such as after being gifted/traded an item or after being saved from an enemy grappling the player. Pressing circle/B when the player's partner scores a headshot or manages to successfully enact a follow-up melee attack will also have their character compliment their partner.</p><p>With the map up, both players will be shown. Though if one player gets out of range of the map, the other player can then hold down L2 directing the player's attention to the location of the other player.</p><h3>Secondary Character AI</h3><p>When playing in single-player the secondary character will still persist, but is now controlled by a friendly AI. However it is still just as vulnerable as the player and shares all of the same gameplay mechanics and trappings, including its own 9-square inventory grid. It will often act of its own accord and will fire at whatever enemy it encounters, regardless of how much ammunition it has. It will heal itself when damaged and usually knows which healing item is most suitable, though it will usually rush to the player first to make sure they both get healed -- regardless of whether the player actually requires healing or not. It will also collect supplies on its own, though will at least give some to the player should they feel the player is in need of them, or if it collected ammunition it can't use. Though this may not always be the case.</p><p>Fortunately it will gladly trade items with the player when requested and will even always thank the player for any assistance as well. However because it tends to go through ammo relatively quickly, it's advised that the human player equips themselves with different weapons to the AI. Such as for example sticking the AI with an SMG or Assault Rifle while the player uses a Handgun. As it's an AI, its accuracy is very high, thus it excels with Sniper Rifles in particular. While it will use whatever firearms it has at its disposal, it will not use any explosive weapons such as the RPG Launcher, Grenade Launcher, or even grenades.</p><p>When the player is forced to split-up with the AI it will follow a specific script, be it collecting the necessary key item or unlocking a door, and will then attempt to regroup with the player ASAP. It will at least attempt to defend itself when necessary, though it will not revert to its default patterns until it is reunited with the player.</p><p>Though while it is largely agreed upon by its community that Resident Evil 5 makes for a better experience when playing cooperatively, it's worth noting there is unique dialogue in the single-player version--dialogue that also differs dependant on whether the player is controlling Chris or Sheva--that isn't heard otherwise.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2685869-goodguys.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2685869\" data-ratio=\"0.56666666666667\" data-width=\"360\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 360px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.7%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2685869-goodguys.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2685869\"><img alt=\"Chris, Sheva, and Josh\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2685869-goodguys.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2685869-goodguys.jpg 360w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2685869-goodguys.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Chris, Sheva, and Josh\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2685869-goodguys.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2685869-goodguys.jpg 360w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2685869-goodguys.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Chris, Sheva, and Josh</figcaption></figure><p>On two occasions the player(s) will be accompanied by BSAA Delta leader, Josh Stone. However he is not playable under any context within the main game and functions as a friendly AI compatriot. Though unlike Sheva, Josh Stone sticks to a script and isn't as dynamic as the player's partner AI. He is often shown trying to work a piece of machinery to help open the way. During the first scenario Josh will defend himself when necessary, equipped with an M9SF pistol, but can also die if he receives enough damage. Though for his second appearance he merely awaits for the players on a boat, and none of the enemies will pay him any heed.</p><p>Josh's melee attacks are a carbon copy of Chris', and it wasn't until the DLC story Desperate Escape that Josh was given his own set of unique attacks.</p><h3>Quick Time Events</h3><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661828-gam210.know.act5_b1_1--article_image.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2661828\" data-ratio=\"0.5622009569378\" data-width=\"418\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 418px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661828-gam210.know.act5_b1_1--article_image.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2661828\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2661828-gam210.know.act5_b1_1--article_image.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661828-gam210.know.act5_b1_1--article_image.jpg 418w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2661828-gam210.know.act5_b1_1--article_image.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2661828-gam210.know.act5_b1_1--article_image.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2661828-gam210.know.act5_b1_1--article_image.jpg 418w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2661828-gam210.know.act5_b1_1--article_image.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>QTEs return and are again most commonly encountered should a player be grabbed by an enemy--which'll require the player to wiggle the right analogue--or in the case of bosses to sometimes avoid an attack entirely. They are also encountered during specific cutscenes, where the player must press the on-screen prompts as they appear otherwise they will die. Sometimes players may also have to rapidly tap a single button as well, usually as a means to further illustrate a scene depicting a struggle for example.</p><p>If playing cooperatively, cutscene QTEs are divided between players depending on which character is doing the action on-screen. Though there are still some that require both players to press the prompts simultaneously.</p><h3>Melee Combat</h3><p>Melee attacks return and have been further expanded upon. When fighting the variety of regular Majini enemies, shooting them in the head, leg, or shoulder will stun them for a couple of seconds, allowing players to then perform a powerful melee attack by way of a prompt next to the stunned enemy. Though depending on which part of the Majini is shot will prompt a different attack -- Chris &amp; Sheva each have unique melee attacks as well. Characters are also invulnerable whilst performing a melee attack, making them suitable for both offence and defense.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2637078-st-106.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2637078\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2637078-st-106.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2637078\"><img alt=\"Chris, managing to hit two Majini at once with a Right Hook\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2637078-st-106.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2637078-st-106.jpg 1280w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/10354/2637078-st-106.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10354/2637078-st-106.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2637078-st-106.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Chris, managing to hit two Majini at once with a Right Hook\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2637078-st-106.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2637078-st-106.jpg 1280w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/10354/2637078-st-106.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10354/2637078-st-106.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2637078-st-106.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Chris, managing to hit two Majini at once with a Right Hook</figcaption></figure><p>Certain melee attacks can be chained between characters, with for example Chris enacting one following by Sheva committing another, with Chris unleashing a final third. The third attack of the chain is extremely powerful and cannot be triggered any other way beyond being the final attack of a combo. They will most often be used against the larger enemies, as they tend to stagger rather than get knocked to the ground like common Majini enemies. When playing alone with the AI, it will attempt to chain melee attacks with the player when possible, though it will usually rely on firearms more so than melee attacks.</p><p>A list of Chris &amp; Sheva's melee attacks are as follows:</p><h4><strong>Chris:</strong></h4><ul><li><strong>Straight Punch</strong> - A straight lung, usually only striking a single enemy but may still knock the enemy far enough to topple over other enemies. Is often comically compared to<a href=\"/captain-falcon/3005-1215/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1215\"> Captain Falcon</a>'s Falcon Punch attack in <a href=\"/nintendo/3010-90/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-90\">Nintendo</a>'s <a href=\"/super-smash-bros/3030-19125/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19125\">Super Smash Brothers</a> franchise. Within the context of a regular Majini enemy, it is actionable when it has been shot to the face and is forced to clasp its face.</li><li><strong>Right Hook</strong> - Chris' weakest attack, though it has a good chance of hitting multiple enemies and is useful for potentially starting a combo with Sheva. Within the context of a regular Majini enemy, this attack is actionable when it has been shot in the left or right shoulder.</li><li><strong>Kick - </strong>Another relatively weak attack, this too is primarily useful for leading into another attack by Sheva. Within the context of a regular Majini enemy, this attack is actionable from behind when it has been shot in the left or right shoulder.</li><li><strong>Uppercut - </strong>Roughly about the same power as the Straight Punch, the uppercut has a better chance of hitting multiple enemies. Within the context of a regular Majini enemy, this attack is actionable from the front when it has been shot at the knee and keels over in pain for a few seconds.</li><li><strong>Neck Snap</strong> - Chris' most powerful attack as it will kill a regular Majini instantly. Within the context of a regular Majini enemy, this attack is actionable from the back when it has been shot at the knee and keels over in pain for a few seconds.</li><li><strong>Stomp - </strong>A very powerful attack, and one that may often act as a finisher due to the damage an enemy may have already received to get knocked over. Within the context of a regular Majini enemy, this attack is actionable when it has been knocked to the ground.</li><li><strong>Haymaker</strong> - Besides the Neck Snap, this is easily Chris' most powerful attack. However it can only be performed as the third attack of a combo chain--beginning with Chris--and when directed at an enemy from the front.</li><li><strong>Backhand</strong> - Like the Haymaker, this too deals an equally incredible amount of damage. However it can only be performed as the third attack of a combo chain--beginning with Chris--and when directed at an enemy from the back.</li><li><strong>Top Down Punch</strong> - A relatively weak attack, this is the attack Chris uses against an enemy that is currently grappling the other character. It visually resembles <a href=\"/ryu/3005-103/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-103\">Ryu</a>'s top down punch from the <a href=\"/street-fighter-alpha/3025-960/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-960\">Street Fighter Alpha</a> series.</li></ul><h4><strong>Sheva:</strong></h4><ul><li><strong>Roundhouse Kick</strong> - A reliable manoeuvre due to its high likelihood that it'll disperse a crowd, and can at least knock an enemy over. Within the context of a regular Majini enemy, it is actionable when it has been shot to the face and is forced to clasp its face.</li><li><strong>Twist Kick</strong> - Sheva's weakest attack, and is only primarily useful for potentially starting a combo chain with Chris. Within the context of a regular Majini enemy, this attack is actionable when it has been shot in the left or right shoulder.</li><li><strong>Knee</strong> - Another relatively weak attack, this too is primarily useful for leading into another attack by Chris. Within the context of a regular Majini enemy, this attack is actionable from behind when it has been shot in the left or right shoulder.</li><li><strong>Somersault</strong> - Somewhat reminiscent of <a href=\"/guile/3005-266/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-266\">Guile</a> from Street Fighter's Flask Kick move, Sheva's somersault does a high amount of damage, but will often only manage to hit a single enemy. Within the context of a regular Majini enemy, this attack is actionable from the front when it has been shot at the knee and keels over in pain for a few seconds.</li><li><strong>Throat Slice</strong> - Sheva's most powerful attack, as like Chris' Neck Snap will kill a regular Majini instantly. However the animation is noticeably longer overall. Within the context of a regular Majini enemy, this attack is actionable from the back when it has been shot at the knee and keels over in pain for a few seconds.</li><li><strong>Impale</strong> - A very powerful attack, even more so than Chris' stomp, and one that may often act as a finisher due to the damage an enemy may have already received to get knocked over. Within the context of a regular Majini enemy, this attack is actionable when it has been knocked to the ground.</li><li><strong>Skull Crusher - </strong>Besides the Throat Slice, this is easily Sheva's most powerful attack. However it can only be performed as the third attack of a combo chain--beginning with Sheva--and when directed at an enemy from the front.</li><li><strong>Spinning Back Kick</strong> - Like the Skull Crusher, this too deals an equally incredible amount of damage.

Upon being forced to fight their way through hordes of infected civilians, the two are able to locate Alpha team of the BSAA, who were planning to apprehend and question Irving. However they are heard in combat via radio and communication is cut off. Chris and Sheva are soon able to locate Alpha team, however it was too late; all of them were killed, with team captain DeChant as the only survivor. He claims they were set-up, but before he can divulge anymore information dies due to his injuries.</p><p>It isn't long before two then encounter what killed Alpha team -- Uroborus, a new type of B.O.W. even Chris hasn't encountered before. Utilising the nearby furnace, they discover it is weak to fire and use it to kill the monster.</p><p>From there they meet up with Josh Stone, captain of the West African branch's Delta team. He provides them with information regarding Irving's whereabouts before going off for backup. Chris &amp; Sheva keep on the tail and are able to corner Irving. However he is rescued by a woman concealed by a bird mask and cloak. The duo are thusly forced to continue the chase.</p><p>Upon meeting up with B.S.A.A. member <a href=\"/dave-johnson/3005-15420/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-15420\">Dave Johnson</a>, they hitch a ride on his humvee. Though upon their arrival at the next checkpoint, they are ambushed by a massive creature called N'desu. It kills Dave, but is then taken down thanks to the weaponry located on the humvee by Chris and Sheva. After travelling through a Tribal Village that has also been infected with the Las Plagas, with the return of Josh they are then able to finally reach Irving once more on his yacht.</p><p>However, Irving injects himself with a Master Plagas sample, rapidly transforming himself into a humongous, amphibious monster. With the use of the gatling and rocket turrets on his boat, the two are able to kill it. Barely hanging on to life, what remains of Irving--who was functioning as the uvula of the creature--upon realising the male agent that killed was Chris Redfield, states the two should head to the nearby cave and look for an ''<a href=\"/excella-gionne/3005-8921/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-8921\">Excella</a>''.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1689389-re5dx9__218_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1689389\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"1440\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1440px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1689389-re5dx9__218_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1689389\"><img alt=\"Excella Gionne\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/62890/1689389-re5dx9__218_.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1689389-re5dx9__218_.jpg 1440w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/6/62890/1689389-re5dx9__218_.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/62890/1689389-re5dx9__218_.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/62890/1689389-re5dx9__218_.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Excella Gionne\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/62890/1689389-re5dx9__218_.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1689389-re5dx9__218_.jpg 1440w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/6/62890/1689389-re5dx9__218_.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/62890/1689389-re5dx9__218_.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/62890/1689389-re5dx9__218_.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Excella Gionne</figcaption></figure><p>Taking his advice, Josh ferries them to the cave, but then departs once again to try and locate help. Chris &amp; Sheva fight their way through the cave, which is infested with more Las Plagas-infected tribesman. They eventually are introduced to Excella, the CEO of Tricell who are in fact a B.S.A.A. benefactor. Like Irving she continually gives them the slip. Upon their chase, Chris discovers that Jill Valentine may actually be alive; footage of her in a test beacon is found on an Umbrella computer. Chris demands answers from Excella, but she instead unleashes a huge crab-like B.O.W. Though this too is bested by the combined skill of Chris and Sheva.</p><p>Upon reaching Excella within an underground temple, Chris' arch-nemesis Albert Wesker reveals himself, alongside the woman wearing the bird mask. The woman is also then revealed to be Jill Valentine, however she is shown to be a puppet of Wesker and follows his command.</p><p>While Excella leaves the scene, Wesker opts to engage in a two-vs-two fight; Chris &amp; Sheva vs Wesker &amp; Jill. Wesker, however, still retains all of his super-human agility and strength, and cannot be fought by normal means. As such, Sheva attempts to keep Jill occupied--whom while is incredibly aggressive is still only human--while Chris lures Wesker into the side corridors of the temple. From there he uses stealth to catch Wesker off guard, doing whatever damage he can. Eventually, Wesker is forced to draw the fight to a premature close due to other business, but leaves Jill to finish them off.</p><p>Jill soon reveals by opening up her battlesuit that she is being controlled by a strange virus that is continually being pumped into her system. Upon Chris using his voice to remind her of him, he is able to temporarily confuse her enough so as to try and tear the device off. With the help of Sheva, they are finally able to tear the thing off completely. While back to her normal self Jill is still in a weakened state, and urges them to go and stop Wesker without her. But only before she indulges vital information regarding Wesker's own virus; by over-dosing him with a specific serum, that'll then course it to act as a poison. She also reveals Wesker's plan to use jets to unleash Uroborus upon the world. With this information in hand, Chris &amp; Sheva go after Wesker.</p><p>Upon arriving on Wesker's battleship, they encounter Excella. However it turns out that she was betrayed by Wesker and infected with Uroborus so as to slow the two down. Excella begins to vomit out black-as-night tentacles, which envelop her as well as a small mountain of corpses nearby Wesker must have placed.</p><p>It grows large enough to practically encompass the entire ship, though with the use of a portable ion cannon Chris &amp; Sheva are able to destroy the creature, while also finding the aforementioned serum in Excella's briefcase amidst it all.</p><p>The two again catch up to Wesker and do battle with him in the hanger; amidst the fight Wesker's explains his motivation to create a new world order via natural selection with Uroborus. With the use of an RPG, they are able to weaken him enough so as to inject the serum. However is able to escape onto a jet; Chris and Sheva soon join him and another battle occurs, with Sheva injecting Wesker with the serum once more.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1689480-re5dx9__306_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1689480\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"1440\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1440px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1689480-re5dx9__306_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1689480\"><img alt=\"Chris, Jill, and Sheva after another day's work\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/62890/1689480-re5dx9__306_.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1689480-re5dx9__306_.jpg 1440w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/6/62890/1689480-re5dx9__306_.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/62890/1689480-re5dx9__306_.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/62890/1689480-re5dx9__306_.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Chris, Jill, and Sheva after another day's work\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/62890/1689480-re5dx9__306_.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62890/1689480-re5dx9__306_.jpg 1440w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/6/62890/1689480-re5dx9__306_.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/62890/1689480-re5dx9__306_.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/62890/1689480-re5dx9__306_.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Chris, Jill, and Sheva after another day's work</figcaption></figure><p>The jet ultimately crash lands near a volcano during the chaos inside.

The Soldier Majini suffer one notable drawback, however, in that some will often be found wearing an array of grenades over their chest, introducing an opportunity for players to take advantage and kill the Majini instantly by shooting the grenades.</p><h3>Common Majini Mutations</h3><p>Like the Ganado before them, once Majini have taken enough damage there is often a high chance that they will mutate into something further.</p><h4>Cephalo</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2637093-maijini_cephalo.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2637093\" data-ratio=\"1.7460317460317\" data-width=\"630\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 630px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:174.6%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2637093-maijini_cephalo.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2637093\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 366px) 100vw, 366px\" data-width=\"366\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2637093-maijini_cephalo.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2637093-maijini_cephalo.jpg 630w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10354/2637093-maijini_cephalo.jpg 549w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2637093-maijini_cephalo.jpg 366w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2637093-maijini_cephalo.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2637093-maijini_cephalo.jpg 630w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10354/2637093-maijini_cephalo.jpg 549w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2637093-maijini_cephalo.jpg 366w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 366px) 100vw, 366px\" data-width=\"366\"></noscript></a></figure><p>The most common mutation, usually brought forth after a successful headshot, Cephalo is a plagas that protrudes out of a Majini's neck, almost resembling a large centipede. The Majini will no longer make use of any weapons they previously used and will instead use the plagas almost like a whip to swipe the player. Because of the many skittering legs that litter the plagas, simply being too close to the mutated Majini can inflict damage without the Majini actually initiating an attack. Damage to the plagas host is now largely ineffective, and the Majini from then on is most vulnerable by shooting the plagas itself.</p><h4>Kipepeo</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2637096-re5-kipepeo.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2637096\" data-ratio=\"1.0227272727273\" data-width=\"880\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 880px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:102.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2637096-re5-kipepeo.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2637096\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px\" data-width=\"625\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2637096-re5-kipepeo.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2637096-re5-kipepeo.jpg 880w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2637096-re5-kipepeo.jpg 625w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2637096-re5-kipepeo.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2637096-re5-kipepeo.jpg 880w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2637096-re5-kipepeo.jpg 625w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px\" data-width=\"625\"></noscript></a></figure><p>The second most common mutation, and another that is largely ported from one such Ganado mutation in Resident Evil 4. This one is a form a flying plagas that bursts out of the Majini's back once it has received enough damage. Once airborne and out of its host, its attacks are sporadic and unpredictable, and it can also quickly dart out of the way should the player aim at it. Otherwise it is relatively weak and can be taken down in groups easy with a few accurate shotgun rounds.</p><h4>Duvalia</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2637097-duvalia.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2637097\" data-ratio=\"1.4\" data-width=\"250\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 250px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:140.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2637097-duvalia.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2637097\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2637097-duvalia.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2637097-duvalia.jpg 250w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2637097-duvalia.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2637097-duvalia.jpg 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Only encountered against the soldier Majini, the Duvalia, as is custom with mutations, occurs once the Majini has received so much damage. Then the Majini begins to rapidly mutate into what almost looks like an exotic flower. The entire upper-half of the Majini is enclosed within an impenetrable shell, with the vulnerable 'mouth' residing with. The Duvalia will primarily try to whack the player using its shell, but given the chance should the player get close enough will open its shell and 'chomp' the player, instantly placing the player in the dying state. The only way to kill it is to shoot the lower regions of the Majini, forcing the Duvalia to fall onto its knees with the shell open, then shooting the inside.</p><h4>Explosion</h4><p>While not a mutation per se, sometimes a soldier Majini will quickly begin to boil and eventually explode after it has taken enough damage.</p><h3>Bui Kichwa</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234135-bui_kichwa.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2234135\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.85470085470085\" data-width=\"936\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 936px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:85.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234135-bui_kichwa.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2234135\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234135-bui_kichwa.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234135-bui_kichwa.jpg 936w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10354/2234135-bui_kichwa.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234135-bui_kichwa.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234135-bui_kichwa.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234135-bui_kichwa.jpg 936w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10354/2234135-bui_kichwa.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234135-bui_kichwa.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>While they were originally meant to be another Majini mutation, for the final game they are instead only encountered independently. Resembling a sort of exotic arachnid, their main attack is to quickly latch around the player. They do minimal damage, but they also restrict the player to only walking as they struggle to remove the Kichwa. This then allows other enemies in the vicinity to more easily attack the player.</p><p>They are otherwise dispatched easily enough with just one or two pistol rounds.

They normally function as highly aggressive dogs, attempting to leap at the player. These can also mutate, however the catalyst is if they are not killed quickly enough rather than should they receive a certain degree of damage.</p><p>Once mutated, their heads open up revealing a large vertically aligned array of sharp teeth surrounding plagas tentacles in the middle.

Reapers are pretty much indestructible lest the player shoots their weak points, which are littered across the back of the Reaper and will sporadically expose themselves only for a second. Should the player manage to shoot one of the weak points, the Reaper keels over revealing two more weak points, finally resulting in the Reaper bending backwards to reveal its most vulnerable region within the middle of its carapace.</p><p>If the player shoots anywhere else besides one of the telegraphed weak points, the Reaper emits a mist which clouds the player's vision of the Reaper. Because of their high demand for precise timing to kill it, and the fact that they can swiftly kill a player instantly should they get close enough, Reapers are arguably one of the most antagonizing enemies of the game.</p><h3>Licker \u03b2</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234145-lickerb.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2234145\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.57857142857143\" data-width=\"560\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 560px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:57.9%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234145-lickerb.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2234145\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234145-lickerb.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234145-lickerb.jpg 560w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10354/2234145-lickerb.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234145-lickerb.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234145-lickerb.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234145-lickerb.jpg 560w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10354/2234145-lickerb.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234145-lickerb.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Primarily recognised for their appearance in <a href=\"/resident-evil-2/3030-9418/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-9418\">Resident Evil 2</a>, Licker \u03b2's are an advanced form of Lickers that have been injected with the progenitor virus.

The most notary difference is for their resistance to bullets, allowing them to withstand copious amounts of firearm fire. Unlike the original Lickers, however, Licker \u03b2's have one particular weakness: Their exposed heart. Because of this, should the player manage to knock a Licker onto its back, they can then commit and instant kill by way of a button prompt allowing them to stab the Licker directly in its heart. One other weakness they have inherited over their predecessors is their inability to see.

The most suitable tactic for beating the creatures is to shoot the small eye it has located on the back on its large hump.</p><p>Unlike the Executioners, should a Guardian manage to grab the player, they need their partner to save them otherwise the player currently grabbed will die - no QTE's to allow them to escape the Guardian's grasp.</p><h3>Crocodiles</h3><p>While not infected, the native crocodiles of West Africa are much more so aggressive than average crocs. They are only encountered during the marshlands: First whilst the player is riding a raft, as the crocodiles attempt to bite them, and secondly as the player is traversing waist-high water to reach a small settlement of huts. On the raft they can only be avoided via QTE's, but when travelling through the water they can be killed. The crocodiles are unusually sturdy against gunfire, however, and should they get close enough can kill the player instantly.</p><h2>Boss Battles</h2><h3>Uroboros Test Subject</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234175-re5_uroboros_concept.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2234175\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.65217391304348\" data-width=\"920\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:65.2%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234175-re5_uroboros_concept.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2234175\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234175-re5_uroboros_concept.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234175-re5_uroboros_concept.jpg 920w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10354/2234175-re5_uroboros_concept.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234175-re5_uroboros_concept.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234175-re5_uroboros_concept.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234175-re5_uroboros_concept.jpg 920w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10354/2234175-re5_uroboros_concept.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234175-re5_uroboros_concept.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Unleashed by Ricardo Irving after the B.S.A.A.

It has fairly slow movement, though it also has the ability to disperse and recreate itself within seconds in another position - possibly right below the player.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234181-030309_re_t.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2234181\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.83333333333333\" data-width=\"300\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 300px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:83.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234181-030309_re_t.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2234181\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234181-030309_re_t.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234181-030309_re_t.jpg 300w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234181-030309_re_t.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234181-030309_re_t.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Initially, ordinary weapons fire is nigh useless against it. Though after it has been attacked by fire, it quickly starts to weaken and tendrils begin to sprout out revealing its weak points. The player can do battle with it this way, though they can also attempt to lure it into the nearby furnace then stun it by using, for example, an incendiary grenade, and then turn on the furnace. It takes two attempts to kill it using this method, but would still save players a great degree of supplies.</p><h3>Popokarimu</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234177-popocarimre5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2234177\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.0769230769231\" data-width=\"650\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 650px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:107.7%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234177-popocarimre5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2234177\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px\" data-width=\"594\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234177-popocarimre5.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234177-popocarimre5.jpg 650w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234177-popocarimre5.jpg 594w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234177-popocarimre5.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234177-popocarimre5.jpg 650w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234177-popocarimre5.jpg 594w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px\" data-width=\"594\"></noscript></a></figure><p>A Bio-Organic Weapon that was being transported to be sold, it is accidentally let loose during a vehicular crash. The Popkarimu is faced twice: First on the outskirts of a mining station, and then again while Chris &amp; Sheva are exploring a series of underground African caves. The first time is mandatory, though the second may be avoided if the player can manage to outrun it. For both appearances the boss fight plays out the same.</p><p>Resembling a giant bat with a scorpions tail, it will switch between chasing the player on the ground, and hounding the player from the air. Popokarimu's front is impenetrable from gunfire, though its rear up its tail is highly vulnerable. The most suitable strategy is for the player to lay down mines; after the Popokarimu comes in vicinity, the explosion will knock it over giving the player ample time to fire at its weak point. Otherwise, if its a cooperative game, one player can always act as bait while the other shoot at its rear.</p><h3>Ndesu</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234174-ndesure5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2234174\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.25\" data-width=\"680\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 680px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:125.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234174-ndesure5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2234174\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" data-width=\"512\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234174-ndesure5.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234174-ndesure5.jpg 680w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234174-ndesure5.jpg 512w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234174-ndesure5.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234174-ndesure5.jpg 680w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234174-ndesure5.jpg 512w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" data-width=\"512\"></noscript></a></figure><p>The successor to El Gigante from Resident Evil 4, Ndesu is Tricell's counterpart. Though it looks similar in appearance, it differs in that it has multiple Las Plagas parasites within rather than a single large Plagas like El Gigante. Unlike in Resident Evil 4 where El Gigante's was faced on foot, Ndesu is fought whilst Chris and Sheva are in a B.S.A.A. Humvee using turrets.</p><p>It attacks using similar such tactics as its El Gigante brethren; with its brute strength it attempts to smash and stamp down on the Humvee, while also picking up power posts and even a boulder to throw at the vehicle. The player is tasked with continually shooting at whatever Ndesu equips to quickly cause him to flinch so he'll drop his weapon. Besides Ndesu there are a small squadron of Kijuju Majin that'll attack the player with molotovs or by using their crossbows. They are easily dispatched thanks to the turret's power, however another group will always return after an allotted time until the battle is over.</p><p>After it takes so much damage, the many Las Plagas within erupt out of its skin. Once they've been killed, Ndesu keels over for a much larger parasite to expose itself out of its back giving players the chance to finally shoot at its weak point. After 2-3 assaults on the main Las Plagas parasite, Ndesu is finally killed.</p><h3>Ricardo Irving</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234172-re5_194.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2234172\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.664\" data-width=\"500\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 500px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.4%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234172-re5_194.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2234172\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10354/2234172-re5_194.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234172-re5_194.jpg 500w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10354/2234172-re5_194.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10354/2234172-re5_194.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234172-re5_194.jpg 500w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10354/2234172-re5_194.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Because of his failure at stopping Chris &amp; Sheva's pursuit, Jill Valentine currently in her 'Bird Lady' outfit hands Irving a vial with a Master Plagas sample, and orders him to use it should he be cornered. As such, once Chris &amp; Sheva manage to finally catch up to Irving on his luxury boat, he gives in to the potential power a Master Plagas would give and injects himself with it.</p><p>It only takes seconds for the parasite to cause Ricardo to mutate; after leaping into the water, Irving soon resurfaces as a monstrously huge amphibious creature. Because this is the work of a Master Plagas, Irving has complete control over his actions. To fight back against the beast, players must use the turrets conveniently located on Irving's boat. Two miniguns and two rocket launchers, players are to shoot at the glowing weak point until it submerges and its tendrils pop out in exchange. Occasionally, it will swim up to attempt to bite the player with its gigantic maw; a button prompt will quickly appear so as the player can avoid the attack. Soon after so much punishment, the creature latches onto the boat as Ricardo, now essentially functioning as the uvula of the monster, reveals himself so as the player can shoot him. After so many attempts, the beast soon spits out Ricardo's body as it dies. Ricardo then soon follows as his sack-like body disintegrates.</p><h3>U-8</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234173-u8.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2234173\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.56105263157895\" data-width=\"950\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 950px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.1%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234173-u8.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2234173\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234173-u8.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234173-u8.jpg 950w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10354/2234173-u8.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234173-u8.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234173-u8.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234173-u8.jpg 950w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10354/2234173-u8.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234173-u8.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>The U standing for 'Ultimate', U-8 is a massive crab-like B.O.W. Excella Gionne unleashes to attempt to kill Chris &amp; Sheva. Acting as a blockade stopping the elevator they're currently on from descending any further, the duo have no choice but to fight against the U-8. Because of its size, its mass stretches across nearly half the size of the elevator; its weak points are the patches of fleshy skin along its claw, however should the player get close, U-8 will often attempt to strafe around the elevator.</p><p>Once enough damage has been done, it will eventually collapse onto the elevator with its mouth agape. This then gives the chance for players to unload at the mouth. Alternatively, players can throw a grenade down its throat (which triggers a small cutscene) to do maximum damage. Each grenade hurled in breaks apart of the armor covering U-8's head, allowing more opportunities to do significant damage. U-8 attacks by performing long range slices with its claws, which'll open a button prompt to help players avoid in time. It will also eventually summon a small array of flying insects to pester players and knock them off their aim when they're shooting U-8's weak points.</p><h3>Uroboros Mkono</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234171-mkono.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2234171\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.71444444444444\" data-width=\"900\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 900px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:71.4%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234171-mkono.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2234171\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234171-mkono.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234171-mkono.jpg 900w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10354/2234171-mkono.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234171-mkono.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234171-mkono.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234171-mkono.jpg 900w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10354/2234171-mkono.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234171-mkono.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>The second helping of Uroboros comes courtesy of Excella Gionne, who once against attempts to halter Chris &amp; Sheva's advance. Though unlike their first encounter, this one is much stronger and there are no conveniently placed furnaces nearby either. Instead players are given multiple gas canisters to drop, along with a flamethrower. The gas canisters, once dropped, will become melded with Uroboros should it move nearby one allowing the player to better maximise the fiery damage potential inflicted. The flamethrower is first stationed on the wall; it has limited ammo, and once used up must be returned so it can be refuelled.</p><p>Tactics for this encounter work pretty much the exact same as the last one and players must use the various fire-related weaponry at their disposal for Uroboros to reveal its weak points. The flamethrower using during the battle is strictly for this battle alone; once it's finished, the player cannot take it with them.</p><h3>Albert Wesker &amp; Jill Valentine</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234225-resident_evil_5_conceptart_z7b45.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2234225\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"2.5316455696203\" data-width=\"237\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 237px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:253.2%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234225-resident_evil_5_conceptart_z7b45.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2234225\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 237px) 100vw, 237px\" data-width=\"237\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234225-resident_evil_5_conceptart_z7b45.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234225-resident_evil_5_conceptart_z7b45.jpg 237w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234225-resident_evil_5_conceptart_z7b45.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234225-resident_evil_5_conceptart_z7b45.jpg 237w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 237px) 100vw, 237px\" data-width=\"237\"></noscript></a></figure><p>After much travel and many B.O.W. creatures killed, Chris &amp; Sheva finally manage to catch up to Excella. However, Albert Wesker soon reveals himself to the duo along with a brainwashed Jill Valentine. Wesker finally decides to settle the score with Chris, and along with Jill, they have a two vs two battle inside an underground temple.</p><p>Despite the circumstances, Jill Valentine is not to be killed and it will result in a game over should that happen. She will have no qualms about attempting to kill the player, however. Albert Wesker of course shares the same philosophy. Ordinarily the player is to try and survive for seven minutes, though the player can also attempt to fight Wesker and should they do enough damage, Wesker will cut the current battle short and leave.</p><p>Albert Wesker because of his increased strength and agility is able to avoid nearly all weaponry fire, and can move about the environment considerably faster than the player. His choice of attack is to quickly charge in and use melee attacks against the player; sometimes he will also swiftly pull out his H&amp;K P8 and shoot two rounds at the player, though the player is given button prompts to avoid the shots. The most reliable strategy to beating Wesker during this stage is to run away; after so long has passed, or if the player heads near the door, Wesker will kick the player through it giving access to the upper floor and its corridors. From there the player can attempt to get some distance between them and Wesker, take cover, and then quickly pop out and shoot him. The same works if one player is able to distract him while another attempts to shoot his back.</p><p>Jill Valentine primarily uses her dual VZ61 submachine guns as she effortlessly scurries throughout the environment. It's advised that one player attempts to keep her busy by throwing a flash grenade or the knife to stun her, then do a context-sensitive melee attack knocking her out temporarily. Despite her fondness for her submachine guns, she will still make use of her acrobatic abilities to attack the player should they get close enough.</p><p>Should the player manage to do enough damage, or if the seven minutes run out, Wesker leaves and the current battle ends. Though if the player manages to beat Wesker by inflicting too much damage, a unique treasure is then dropped within the area.</p><h3>Jill Valentine Part II</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234233-jillbattlesuit.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2234233\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"1024\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234233-jillbattlesuit.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2234233\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-width=\"640\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234233-jillbattlesuit.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234233-jillbattlesuit.jpg 1024w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10354/2234233-jillbattlesuit.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234233-jillbattlesuit.jpg 640w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234233-jillbattlesuit.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234233-jillbattlesuit.jpg 1024w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10354/2234233-jillbattlesuit.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234233-jillbattlesuit.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-width=\"640\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Once Albert Wesker has left, he then leaves it to the still brainwashed Jill Valentine to finish Chris &amp; Sheva after revealing the device on her chest that is the source of her behaviour. Jill functions much like she did during the previous battle against her and Wesker. She will scurry around almost like a wild animal--she will even hiss on occasion--while using her submachine guns and her athletic melee attacks to kill the player.</p><p>The player is a still not to kill Jill and must now attempt to use Chris' voice to 'awaken' Jill by using the A/X (default 360/PS3 controls) while avoiding her attacks; should the player be playing as Sheva in single-player, pressing A/X will still automatically have Chris call out to Jill. Once Chris manages to temporarily get through to her, the device begins to malfunction giving the players time to try and rip the device off. Though when this happens, the player is given two possible choices on how to respond: The player can either use a melee attack, knocking Jill to the ground, and then attempt to pull off the device that way, or one player (or the AI) can grab a hold of Jill while the other player (or AI) can attempt to rip the device off.</p><p>The first option is more effective and will require less tries, though tearing off the device by using the second option will award the player with a trophy/achievement.</p><h3>Uroboros Aheri</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234170-aheri.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2234170\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.69868995633188\" data-width=\"1145\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1145px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:69.9%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234170-aheri.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2234170\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234170-aheri.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234170-aheri.jpg 1145w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/10354/2234170-aheri.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10354/2234170-aheri.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234170-aheri.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234170-aheri.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234170-aheri.jpg 1145w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/10354/2234170-aheri.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10354/2234170-aheri.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2234170-aheri.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>What was once the beautiful Excella Gionne, Albert Wesker's betrayal has forced her to become a monstrously huge Uroboros creature. After absorbing a small mount of corpses, the third encounter with Uroboros quickly grows to the entire size of the ship cruiser. At first Chris &amp; Sheva retreat back into the ship during a small QTE sequence; once they arrive back inside the ship, the players only interaction with Uroboros is by avoiding its many surprise attacks.</p><p>Eventually they reach the back of the ship, and along with a portable Ion Cannon weapon do battle with the monster. First the player is to shoot the exposed bulbs, while avoiding its reactionary attacks via a button prompt, and after they've all been extinguished, the 'brain' of the creature is exposed giving players the opportunity to use the Ion Cannon to shoot at it. All the while, Aheri will continuously spawn small Uroboros monsters; they're relatively weak and should often be left as duty for the other player.</p><h3>Albert Wesker Part II</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234290-123491_728348_wesker_noglasses_la.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2234290\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.0933333333333\" data-width=\"300\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 300px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:109.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234290-123491_728348_wesker_noglasses_la.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2234290\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234290-123491_728348_wesker_noglasses_la.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234290-123491_728348_wesker_noglasses_la.jpg 300w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234290-123491_728348_wesker_noglasses_la.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234290-123491_728348_wesker_noglasses_la.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Fighting near a runway, Chris &amp; Sheva have finally caught up to Wesker and are planning to inject him with a serum that'll neutralize the virus that enhances his strength and agility. Wesker still uses the same sort of attacks as he did when fighting against him previously, though the tactics for beating him have changed. Now players are to turn off the lights so as to stay hidden from Wesker; using an RPG, they are to then shoot at Wesker, who will often grab a hold of it just before it hits him, then shoot the rocket, and finally attempt to inject the serum.</p><p>It usually takes around 3-4 tries before it's finally successful. Between each attempt, however, the player must find other rockets littered about the environment, and then the other player (or AI) must help reload it. After the first attempt, Wesker will then start throwing missiles at the player, but his usual array of attacks revolving around his enhanced agility are what fill out the most of his tactics.</p><p>A similar fight against Wesker also occurs at the end of the Lost in Nightmares story DLC that takes place during the flashback when Chris &amp; Jill are exploring Ozwell E. Spencer's current residence. Though naturally he doesn't have any missiles to throw. Like the battle against both Wesker &amp; Jill, this battle can either end two ways. Either the hidden timer will end, forcing the cutscene to trigger, or the player will be able to do enough damage that it will end prematurely. If players manage to beat Wesker by way of inflicting enough damage, they are awarded a trophy/achievement.</p><h3>Albert Wesker Part III</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234299-big_boss_of_the_day_resident_evils_albert_wesker_20100216014010447_000.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2234299\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.3521126760563\" data-width=\"355\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 355px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:135.2%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234299-big_boss_of_the_day_resident_evils_albert_wesker_20100216014010447_000.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2234299\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 473px) 100vw, 473px\" data-width=\"473\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234299-big_boss_of_the_day_resident_evils_albert_wesker_20100216014010447_000.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234299-big_boss_of_the_day_resident_evils_albert_wesker_20100216014010447_000.jpg 355w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234299-big_boss_of_the_day_resident_evils_albert_wesker_20100216014010447_000.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2234299-big_boss_of_the_day_resident_evils_albert_wesker_20100216014010447_000.jpg 355w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 473px) 100vw, 473px\" data-width=\"473\"></noscript></a></figure><p>The final battle located within a volcano - Wesker has now allowed a containment of Uroboros to meld with his DNA, only this time Uroboros actually agrees with its host's DNA. As such, Wesker has full control of his enhanced powers and abilities. His appearance is still altered, however, as the majority of his upper-body is enveloped in the traditional black tentacles that Uroboros is made of.</p><p>This fight goes through a small number of stages. First, the player is to run away until Chris &amp; Sheva are inadvertently split up. One player is then forced to keep on running while the other must gain Wesker's attention from afar. Sheva will be running alongside a small pathway while Chris is further below. Reagardless of whom Wesker decides to follow, it's up to the other to safeguard them while either: Sheva is attempting to climb back up after apart of the pathway crumbles beneath her feet, or while Chris is attempting to move a boulder out of his way. Then when both characters are reunited, the player is to lead Wesker up to a small hilltop. From there the ending battle begins.</p><p>Players are intended to shoot Wesker in his heart-like orifice which is initially exposed within his back. After enough shots, it will also become visible from his chest as well. Wesker attacks using his Uroboros arms as whips, while also attempting to grapple players; should a player be grabbed, they'll need the assistance of their partner to escape.</p><p>To beat Wesker, players could simply follow the routine of shooting his heart. However, once Wesker is stunned, player's can instead choose to run forward and initiate a QTE event showing Chris &amp; Sheva stab at his heart from both sides -- eventually resulting in the player winning the battle. Wesker is then ultimately killed when the player shoots him with an RPG launcher via a button prompt during the following cutscene.</p><h2>Unlockables</h2><p>Several <a href=\"/unlockables/3015-1414/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1414\">unlockables</a> can be achieved in Resident Evil 5, most if not all are gained when finishing the game once, and most of which are achieved by a separate shop system using points gained from performance in the story mode or Mercenaries at the end of the game.

There are 12 chapters in all, and by the time players finish the story mode, they will have unlocked all 12 files. These files are biographies, histories, and documents about the game's fiction including topics such as the origin of Umbrella corporation, Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance (BSAA), Biological Organic Weapons (BOWs), S.T.A.R.S., the previous protagonist and heroines, group of eleven and so forth.</p><h2>The Mercenaries</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>Unlocked simply by completing the main game on any difficulty, The Mercenaries is a classic Resident Evil <a href=\"/minigames/3015-116/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-116\">mini-game</a> first introduced in Resident Evil 4. Based around arena combat, the player is to kill as many enemies as they can within the time limit; killing enemies within quick succession will start up a combo meter, which often leads to a substantial amount of points. Beginning with 2:00 minutes, the players can extend their time by locating the many time bonuses hidden throughout the map; any enemies killed via a melee attack will also reward the player with a 5 second bonus. Josh Stone acts as the announcer for both the beginning and ending of a Mercenaries match.</p><p>Leaderboards are available for players to show off their scores, and filters can be set to allow players to see their overall ranking worldwide, or to see how well they've done when compared against their friends.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/917927-mercenaries_010.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-917927\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/917927-mercenaries_010.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-917927\"><img alt=\"One of the time bonuses in the Public Assembly map\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/30/917927-mercenaries_010.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/917927-mercenaries_010.jpg 1280w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/30/917927-mercenaries_010.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/917927-mercenaries_010.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/30/917927-mercenaries_010.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"One of the time bonuses in the Public Assembly map\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/30/917927-mercenaries_010.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/917927-mercenaries_010.jpg 1280w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/30/917927-mercenaries_010.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/917927-mercenaries_010.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/30/917927-mercenaries_010.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>One of the time bonuses in the Public Assembly map</figcaption></figure><p>For each of the different maps, there exist mini-bosses taken from the main game who will appear sporadically.

Killing these foes gains the player a sizeable point bonus, as well a 100% chance to drop some added supplies, be it a first-aid spray or some ammunition. Once a player's health reaches the ''dying'' state, they are to tap the O/B (default PS3/360 controls) quickly so they can regenerate their health back to its minimum.</p><p>Once time has run out, the player is then scored from D to SS (SS requiring above 90K) based upon their performance, which is graded on not only how many overall enemies the player killed, but also how high their combo meter reached.

Each character has been fitted with their own unique dialogue as well - including Wesker, who will often shout out ''Useless!'' should the other player perish in a 2-player round.</p><h3><b>Characters:</b></h3><table data-max-width=\"true\"><thead><tr><th scope=\"col\">Character</th><th scope=\"col\">Starting Inventory</th><th scope=\"col\">Unlock with an A or higher Rank on:</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Chris Redfield (B.S.A.A.)</strong></td><td><ul><li>M92F Handgun w/ 20 Rounds</li><li>Ithaca M37 Shotgun w/ 20 Rounds</li><li>5 Hand Grenades</li><li>50 Handgun Bullets</li><li>10 Shotgun Shells</li><li>First Aid Spray</li></ul></td><td>Unlocked by default.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Chris Redfield (Safari)</strong></td><td><ul><li>SIG P226 Handgun w/ 16 Rounds</li><li>M3 Shotgun w/ 10 Rounds</li><li>RPG Launcher</li><li>RPG Launcher</li><li>30 Handgun Bullets</li><li>10 Shotgun Shells</li></ul></td><td>Village map.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Chris Redfield (S.T.A.R.S.)</strong></td><td><ul><li>SIG 556 Assault Rifle w/ 65 bullets</li><li>S&amp;W M29 Magnum w/ 12 bullets</li><li>Grenade Launcher w/ 12 Electric Grenades</li><li>150 Machinegun Bullets</li><li>6 Magnum Bullets</li></ul></td><td>Experimental Facility map.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Sheva Alomar (B.S.A.A.)</strong></td><td><ul><li>M92F Pistol w/ 40 rounds.</li><li>VZ61 Machinepistol w/ 150 rounds.</li><li>Dragunov Sniper Rifle w/ 13 Rounds</li><li>50 Handgun Bullets</li><li>150 Machinegun Bullets</li><li>First Aid Spray</li></ul></td><td>Unlocked by default.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Sheva Alomar (Clubbin')</strong></td><td><ul><li>AK74 Assault Rifle w/ 50 Rounds</li><li>Jail Breaker Shotgun w/ 8 Rounds</li><li>S75 Sniper Rifle w/ 20 Rounds</li><li>100 Machinegun Bullets</li><li>20 Shotgun Shells</li><li>10 Sniper Rifle Bullets</li></ul></td><td>Ancient Ruins map.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Sheva Alomar (Tribal)</strong></td><td><ul><li>Bow w/ Infinite Ammo</li><li>Grenade Launcher w/ 6 Ice Rounds</li><li>3 Flame Grenades</li><li>3 Flash Grenades</li><li>First Aid Spray</li></ul></td><td>Missile Area map.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Jill Valentine (B.S.A.A.)</strong></td><td><ul><li>PX4 Handgun w/ 25 Rounds</li><li>H&amp;K MP5 Submachine Gun w/ 150 Rounds</li><li>5 Flash Grenades</li><li>50 Handgun Bullets</li><li>150 Machinegun Bullets</li><li>First Aid Spray</li></ul></td><td>Public Assembly map.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Jill Valentine (Battle Suit)</strong></td><td><ul><li>VZ61 Machinepistol w/ 300 Rounds</li><li>H&amp;K PSG1 Sniper Rifle w/ 9 Rounds</li><li>3 Hand Grenades</li><li>150 Machinegun Bullets</li><li>30 Sniper Rifle Bullets</li><li>Mixed Herb made up of 2 Green</li></ul></td><td>Ship Deck map.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Albert Wesker (Midnight)</strong></td><td><ul><li>H&amp;K P8 Handgun w/ 15 Rounds</li><li>S&amp;W M500 Magnum w/ 6 Rounds</li><li>5 Hand Grenades</li><li>5 Proximity Mines</li><li>50 Handgun Bullets</li><li>5 Magnum Bullets</li></ul></td><td>The Mines map.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Albert Wesker (S.T.A.R.S.)</strong></td><td><ul><li>Samurai Edge Handgun w/ 15 Rounds</li><li>Hydra Shotgun w/ 6 Rounds</li><li>Lightning Hawk Magnum w/ 8 Rounds</li><li>30 Handgun Bullets</li><li>10 Shotgun Shells</li></ul></td><td>Prison map.</td></tr></tbody></table><h3><b>Maps</b></h3><h4><b>Public Assembly</b> - Taken from story Chapter 1-2.</h4><p><strong>Enemies:</strong></p><ul><li>Village Majini</li><li>Instigator Majini</li><li>Executioner Majini (Miniboss)</li></ul><h4><b>The Mines</b> - Taken from story Chapter 2-2.</h4><p><strong>Enemies:</strong></p><ul><li>Village Majini</li><li>Big Man Majini</li><li>Reaper (Miniboss)</li></ul><h4><b>Village</b> - Taken from story Chapter 3-2.</h4><p><strong>Enemies:</strong></p><ul><li>Wetlands Majini</li><li>Bui Kichwa</li><li>Giant Majini (Miniboss)</li></ul><h4><b>Ancient Ruins</b> - Taken from story Chapter 4-1</h4><p><strong>Enemies:</strong></p><ul><li>Wetlands Majini</li><li>Giant Majini (Miniboss)</li></ul><h4><b>Experimental Facility</b> - Taken from story Chapter 5-2</h4><p><strong>Enemies:</strong></p><ul><li>Soldier Majini</li><li>Licker \u03b2</li></ul><h4><b>Missile Area</b> - Taken from story Chapter 6-2</h4><p><strong>Enemies:</strong></p><ul><li>Soldier Majini</li><li>Gatling Gun Majini (Miniboss)</li></ul><h4><b>Ship Deck</b> - Taken from story Chapter 6-1</h4><p><strong>Enemies:</strong></p><ul><li>Villager Majini</li><li>Chainsaw Majini (Miniboss)</li></ul><h4><b>Prison -</b> An all new environment built specifically for the Mercenaries mode.</h4><p><strong>Enemies:</strong></p><ul><li>Villager Majini</li><li>Big Man Majini</li><li>Executioner Majini</li></ul><h2><a href=\"/downloadable-content/3015-329/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-329\"><b>Downloadable Content</b></a></h2><h3>Versus</h3><p>The Versus pack was released soon after the game's initial launch. It features two game types: Slayers Mode, which is a \"point-based game that challenges players to kill Majinis,\" while Survivors Mode is the game's take on deathmatch. 1v1 or 2v2 is available for both game types. The games are essentially the classic Mercenaries modes with team-based gameplay. The Slayers game mode lets players earn points for killing Majinis and other creatures.</p><p>The Survivors mode pits players against each other and they earn points for getting kills. While Majinis and other creatures will be present in this mode as well, players do not get points for killing them. <i>Versus</i> is the least popular of the DLC, given that RE5's control scheme does not lend itself well to deathmatch.</p><h3>Lost in Nightmares</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/70497/1208606-re5___jill_valentine___chris_redfield_rs.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1208606\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.36875\" data-width=\"800\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:136.9%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/70497/1208606-re5___jill_valentine___chris_redfield_rs.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1208606\"><img alt=\"Chris &amp; Jill\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 467px) 100vw, 467px\" data-width=\"467\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/7/70497/1208606-re5___jill_valentine___chris_redfield_rs.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/70497/1208606-re5___jill_valentine___chris_redfield_rs.jpg 800w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/7/70497/1208606-re5___jill_valentine___chris_redfield_rs.jpg 701w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/7/70497/1208606-re5___jill_valentine___chris_redfield_rs.jpg 467w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Chris &amp; Jill\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/7/70497/1208606-re5___jill_valentine___chris_redfield_rs.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/70497/1208606-re5___jill_valentine___chris_redfield_rs.jpg 800w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/7/70497/1208606-re5___jill_valentine___chris_redfield_rs.jpg 701w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/7/70497/1208606-re5___jill_valentine___chris_redfield_rs.jpg 467w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 467px) 100vw, 467px\" data-width=\"467\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Chris &amp; Jill</figcaption></figure><p>The Lost in Nightmares DLC is a 1-2 hour mini-campaign, playable in singleplayer or co-op. While it's generally rather short, the game cannot be saved and must be completed in one go.</p><p>Lost in Nightmares follows Chris &amp; Jill during the BSAA mission glimpsed in flashback amidst the main campaign. Set in 2005, three years before Resident Evil 5's story occurs, Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine are to infiltrate a mansion to locate <a href=\"/ozwell-e-spencer/3005-10018/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-10018\">Ozwell E. Spencer</a>, the founder of the sinister Umbrella Corporation. The mini-campaign is deliberately reminiscent of the original <a href=\"/resident-evil/3030-5842/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5842\">Resident Evil</a>, with innumerable easter eggs and references. These include:</p><ul><li>Jill Valentine having to play moonlight sonata to open a secret passage within a wall.</li><li>Jill also having to lockpick a door.</li><li>An Itchy Tasty reference.</li><li>Cranks.</li><li>A remix of the original Resident Evil Save Room theme that plays over the results screen.</li><li>The ability to play the first third in the mansion with camera angles in place, should the player examine the entrance three times.</li></ul><p>Lost in Nightmares focuses heavily on puzzles over combat, with only one type of enemy across the story -- a new creature called the Guardian of Insanity, which is similar to the Executioner from Resident Evil 5's campaign. However, multiple Guardians are encountered throughout; most are scripted to show up, however the very firsts appearance is random.</p><p>The player's inventory from the main game cannot be transferred into Lost in Nightmare, and both Chris &amp; Jill will always begin with the same M92F pistols. Other weapons can be acquired within the mansion, although what weapons players will find are randomized. The list of weapons that can be found are but a fraction of what can be attained in the main game, however. A list of potential weapons the player may find is as such:</p><ul><li>M3 Shotgun</li><li>H&amp;K Handgun</li><li>S&amp;W Magnum Revolver</li><li>PSG1 Sniper Rifle</li><li>MP5 SMG</li></ul><p>The mini-campaign ultimately concludes with Jill and Chris fighting the ill-fated boss encounter with Wesker depicted in the flashback, which functions exactly like the default Wesker battle from the core game. Wesker can similarly be beaten by either surviving long enough to trigger the cutscene, or by dealing enough damage to end the fight prematurely.</p><p>BSAA emblems, similar to the ones found in the main game, are hidden throughout the area and can be shot for points.</p><h3>Desperate Escape</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2636878-resident-evil-5-dlc-desperate-escape1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2636878\" data-ratio=\"0.56315789473684\" data-width=\"570\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 570px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2636878-resident-evil-5-dlc-desperate-escape1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2636878\"><img alt=\"Jill &amp; Josh\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2636878-resident-evil-5-dlc-desperate-escape1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2636878-resident-evil-5-dlc-desperate-escape1.jpg 570w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10354/2636878-resident-evil-5-dlc-desperate-escape1.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2636878-resident-evil-5-dlc-desperate-escape1.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Jill &amp; Josh\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2636878-resident-evil-5-dlc-desperate-escape1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2636878-resident-evil-5-dlc-desperate-escape1.jpg 570w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10354/2636878-resident-evil-5-dlc-desperate-escape1.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2636878-resident-evil-5-dlc-desperate-escape1.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Jill &amp; Josh</figcaption></figure><p>The Desperate Escape DLC is another 1-2 hour mini-campaign, this time focusing on the actions of Jill Valentine and Josh Stone immediately after the boss fight against a mind-controlled Jill. Jill and Josh must flee the TriCell Facility while Chris and Sheva pursue Wesker. Unlike Lost in Nightmares, Desperate Escape focuses almost entirely on combat, with players constantly being ambushed by Majini of all varieties as they make their way across all new environments. Though what enemies the player will face during a playthrough is randomized.</p><p>Like Lost in Nightmares the player's inventory from the core game cannot be transferred over, and both Jill &amp; Josh begin with a pre-set inventory. Many more weapons and supplies can be procured in the field, though they are once again random. The same listing of weapons that can be found in Lost in Nightmares is the same here, only with the added chance of locating an RPG launcher.</p><p>It ends with a last stand, where Jill and Josh must defend themselves until a rescue helicopter comes to save them. This explains how they got their hands on one in time for the main campaign's finale. Like Versus and Lost in Nightmares, Desperate Escape is playable in singleplayer or co-op, splitscreen or online, and costs $5 on Playstation Network or XBox Live Marketplace.</p><p>BSAA emblems can once again be found and shot to increase the player's overall score.</p><p>The game became available for purchase on February 16, 2010 on the Xbox Live platform Games on Demand for $29.99 USD. All three DLC packs were included in the new Resident Evil 5 Gold Edition.</p><h2>Mercenaries Reunion</h2><p>A remix of Resident Evil 5's original Mercenaries minigame, Reunion is first made available should the player purchase the Lost in Nightmares pack or Desperate Escape pack, and is also packed within the Gold Edition of Resident Evil 5. All of the available characters are packed in as well, however should the player only purchase Lost in Nightmares or Desperate Escape, the roster list is cut in half. Because Reunion is a separate mode from the default Mercenaries mode, each set of characters is exclusive to each mode, disallowing the option for having Barry Burton and Albert Wesker team up in 2-player for example.</p><p>Because the roles of Josh and Jill have been reversed (Josh now being playable while Jill is not), Jill is the announcer for Mercenaries Reunion.</p><h3><b>Characters - Lost in Nightmare Unlocks</b></h3><table data-max-width=\"true\"><thead><tr><th scope=\"col\">Character</th><th scope=\"col\">Starting Inventory</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Barry Burton (S.T.A.R.S.)</strong></td><td><ul><li>Samurai Edge Handgun w/ 30 Rounds</li><li>S&amp;W M29 Magnum w/ 12 Rounds</li><li>Dragunov Sniper Rifle w/ 18 Rounds</li><li>50 Handgun Bullets</li><li>6 Magnum Bullets</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Excella Gionne (TriCell)</strong></td><td><ul><li>M93R Raffica Pistol w/ 30 Rounds</li><li>AK74 Assault Rifle w/ 50 Rounds</li><li>Grenade Launcher w/ 12 Flash Rounds</li><li>50 Handgun Bullets</li><li>150 Machinegun Bullets</li><li>First Aid Spray</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table><h3><strong>Characters - Desperate Escape Unlocks</strong></h3><table data-max-width=\"true\"><thead><tr><th scope=\"col\">Character</th><th scope=\"col\">Starting Inventory</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Rebecca Chambers (S.T.A.R.S.)</strong></td><td><ul><li>H&amp;K MP5 Submachine Gun w/ 120 Rounds</li><li>Jail Breaker Shotgun w/ 10 Rounds</li><li>150 Machinegun Bullets</li><li>150 Machinegun Bullets</li><li>30 Shotgun Shells</li><li>30 Shotgun Shells</li><li>First Aid Spray</li><li>First Aid Spray</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Josh Stone (B.S.A.A.)</strong></td><td><ul><li>M92F Handgun w/ 100 Rounds</li><li>M3 Shotgun w/ 7 Rounds</li><li>RPG Launcher</li><li>3 Hand Grenades</li><li>10 Handgun Bullets</li><li>10 Shotgun Shells</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Characters - Costume DLC Unlocks</h3><table data-max-width=\"true\"><thead><tr><th scope=\"col\">Character</th><th scope=\"col\">Starting Inventory</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Chris Redfield (Warrior)</strong></td><td><ul><li>H&amp;K P8 Handgun w/ 25 Rounds</li><li>Hydra Shotgun w/ 10 Rounds</li><li>H&amp;K PSG1 Sniper Rifle w/ 15 Rounds</li><li>30 Handgun Bullets</li><li>15 Shotgun Shells</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Chris Redfield (Heavy Metal)</strong></td><td><ul><li>Gatling Gun w/ Infinite Ammo</li><li>Cattle Prod</li><li>3 Proximity Mines</li><li>3 Hand Grenades</li><li>Melee Vest</li><li>Bulletproof Vest</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Sheva Alomar (Fairy Tale)</strong></td><td><ul><li>SIG 556 Assault Rifle w/ 80 Rounds</li><li>Ithaca M37 Shotgun w/ 25 Rounds</li><li>S&amp;W M500 Magnum w/ 6 Rounds</li><li>100 Machinegun Bullets</li><li>10 Shotgun Shells</li><li>6 Magnum Bullets</li><li>5 Golden Eggs</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Sheva Alomar (Business Lady)</strong></td><td><ul><li>SIG P226 Handgun w/ 16 Rounds</li><li>Lightning Hawk Magnum w/ 8 Rounds</li><li>5 Proximity Mines</li><li>50 Handgun Bullets</li><li>12 Magnum Bullets</li><li>First Aid Spray</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Maps</h3><p>Reunion features all of the same maps from the original mode.

It was initially developed to be a single-player game like Resident Evil 4 before it and zombies were once again the primary opponents the player would face. Other such revisions include Jill Valentine being Chris' Partner instead of Sheva Alomar. Furthermore, even when planned as a single-player game, Jill would still appear in the game and could in fact permanently die during the story based upon a player choice. Sheva was always planned to star in the game one way or the other, only she was originally depicted as a member of a guerilla group instead of the BSAA.</p><p>Excella Gionne was to initially be featured in the game as a TriCell secretary as opposed to being the head of its West African division. What is now known as her role in RE5 was to be filled in by a male ''CEO type character'', to whom she and Wesker would betray, though only before Wesker would also ultimately betray Excella.</p><p>One notable mechanic that was removed mid-development was that of heat disorientation. Should the player have been wandering around out in the sun for too long, their character would start to become disorientated and would even begin to hallucinate. Players would then have to find some shade to take cover from the beating down sun and recuperate.</p><h3>Racism Controversy</h3><p>After the first full gameplay trailer was released during 2007's E3, many interpreted the trailer depicting a lone white character (Chris Redfield) killing infected colored African Majini as to feature racist overtones. However the next trailer then showcased more common Majini varieties besides those of a dark complexion, including Caucasian and some that even look vaguely Spanish. Sheva Alomar, a West African native, was also confirmed to star as Chris' partner during the very same trailer.</p><p>Resident Evil 5 producer <a href=\"/masachika-kawata/3040-32929/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-32929\">Masachika Kawata</a> stated in response to the criticisms \"We can't please everyone. We're in the entertainment business \u2013 we're not here to state our political opinion or anything like that. It's unfortunate that some people felt that way.\" Lead producer <a href=\"/jun-takeuchi/3040-41365/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-41365\">Jun Takeuchi </a>also expressed surprise at the complaints, and refuted any claims that the game was altered in any way as a reaction to the accusations.</p><h3>Demo</h3><p>On Friday, December 5th, 2008 a demo for the game was put on <a href=\"/xbox-live-marketplace/3045-86/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-86\">XBLA</a> for Japan. Included in the demo are two stages, Shanty Town and District, which can be played either on solo, or via offline or online Co-op play, which is a highlighted new feature in Resident Evil 5. With some clever snooping on the Internet, one would have been able to acquire the demo for the 360 version of the game. For those who patiently waited, the 360 demo was released on January 26 via the Xbox Live Marketplace being exclusive to Gold Xbox Live members for a week. It was released on PS3 via the Playstation Store a week later on February 2nd.</p><h2>Trivia</h2><ul><li>Jill coincidentally bears a somewhat close resemblance to <a href=\"/fiona/3005-2146/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2146\">Fiona</a>, the protagonist of the Capcom game <a href=\"/haunting-ground/3030-2842/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2842\">Haunting Ground</a>.</li><li>Sheva is the first left-handed playable character in the Resident Evil franchise, and the camera is positioned over her left shoulder to compensate; in addition, her HUD is horizontally flipped from the other characters'. The reason for this is to create a more pleasing visual when playing the game in co-op split-screen mode.</li><li>Chris Redfield's voice actor in RE5, <a href=\"/roger-smith/3040-4136/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-4136\">Roger Craig Smith</a>, also voiced antagonist Curtis Miller from the straight-to-DVD RE feature flick <i><a href=\"/tang-resident-evil-degeneration/2300-319/\" data-ref-id=\"2300-319\">Resident Evil: Degeneration</a>.</i></li><li>During Chapter 1-1, should players let Chris &amp; Sheva go idle for a few minutes, this will then trigger a secret conversation between the two where they talk about elements of North American culture.</li><li>During development, the Uroboros creature was nicknamed 'Wriggles' by the staff.</li></ul><h2>Soundtrack</h2><figure

In early 2008, Red Alert 3 was formally announced for a \"Red October\" release on PC. The Xbox 360 version was released a month later and the PS3 version was on hold until March of 2009.</p><h2>Story</h2><p>On the verge of being defeated by the Allies, Soviet leadership executes a desperate plan. The Soviets have secretly build a time machine underneath the Kremlin. Using this time machine, Soviet leaders travel back in time and kill <a href=\"/albert-einstein/3005-791/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-791\">Albert Einstein</a>, thus removing all the technology that he would have built to help the Allies. Returning to the present, the Soviets are on the verge of conquering all of Europe. However, this time alteration has unwittingly created a new superpower, the Empire of the Rising Sun. Thus the world is plunged into a three way war.</p><p>The game features a roughly 10 mission campaign for each faction. The Empire campaign is locked until the player finishes the Soviet and Allied campaigns. There are three possible endings, each putting their respective faction as the victor of the war. The Allies' ending is the canonical one.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>The colorful, campy feel of the Red Alert series will returns in Red Alert 3, ranging from <a href=\"/full-motion-video/3015-604/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-604\">full-motion video</a> mission briefings and story sequences, as well as outlandish units. New to Command &amp; Conquer is the option for cooperative campaign play. Players can play online with their friend, or choose to play alone, in which case an AI controlled Commander helps out. When playing alone, players can give some generic orders to their co-commander, such as attack specific target. Naval battles play an important role in Red Alert 3, with almost all multiplayer maps featuring large bodies of water for naval units. The game does away with the traditional fields of ore for resources and instead features finite ore mines that only require a single harvester.</p><p>The game features three factions, each with differences that dictate how they play. The Allies have unique technologies such as Prism beams and cloaking fields as well as being the air power faction. Soviets focus on brute strength with powerful tanks. The Empire has a strong navy and transforming units. Each faction builds and techs up differently.</p><p>The Allies build in the typical CnC style, but buildings will not expand the buildable zone of the base. Tech is upgraded via the MCV or the outpost and all buildings within the build zone will gain the benefits of tech making the Allies very versatile. However teching as the Allies is also the most expensive and time consuming.</p><p>Soviets have to immediately place their buildings and let them be constructed in the field. Buildings will increase the build zone however. Tech is upgraded via each production structure and is carried by future structures.</p><p>The Empire does away with the tradition CnC build method entirely. Instead the MCV produces mobile building cores which can be moved anywhere on the map before being deployed into buildings, which then take some time to construct. This allows the Empire to build anywhere although the farther away from the MCV, the longer the build time. Tech is cheaper than the other factions but it only applies to that specific production structure.

Users must authenticate online are only able to install the game five times. Any additional installs require contact with EA support. Uninstalling the game does not give back an install. Since release, patches have eased the stringent DRM, allowing uninstalls to give back an install and allow players to de-authorize the game. The Red Alert development team has stated that once the popularity of the game wanes and the servers go down, a patch will likely come out to remove the online authentication. The Steam version initially had SecuRom but is now protected through Steam.</p><h2>Expansion Pack</h2><p>Red Alert 3's first expansion pack: <a href=\"/command-conquer-red-alert-3-uprising/3030-25034/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-25034\">Command &amp; Conquer : Red Alert 3 : Uprising</a> was released on March 13th, 2009.

Their senses allow dogs to detect disguised Spies and Sudden Transports. Its secondary ability allows the dog to roar via an amplifier which stuns enemies.</li><li><h3>Peacekeeper:</h3> The Peacekeeper is the main infantry unit, it carries a combat shotgun which is devastating to infantry at close range. Its secondary ability swaps to a shield, this shield greatly reduces damage but also slows the unit down.</li><li><h3>Engineer:</h3> The Engineer, like in past games can capture neutral or hostile buildings and repair allied buildings. The Engineer can deploy itself into a medical tent to heal allied infantry. Engineers are amphibious.</li></ul><ul><li><h3>Javelin Soldier:</h3> The Javelin soldier is a powerful anti-tank and building unit but it has a long reload time. Its secondary ability locks onto an enemy building or vehicle allowing it to fire faster and deal more damage, although it takes time to lock on.</li></ul><ul><li><h3>Spy:</h3> The Spy has the ability to infiltrate any enemy building. This can give unit information, money, power down their base or other things depending on what building it infiltrates. The Spy can cloak itself to look like an enemy infantry, and also buy off enemy units that are within range for $1000.</li></ul><ul><li><h3>Tanya:</h3> Tanya is the allied commando, she is deadly to infantry. Tanya can also destroy vehicles and buildings by planting a bomb on them. Tanya has a time belt which allows her, when activated, to revert back in time a few seconds to escape danger. Like all commando units, she is amphibious.</li></ul><h3>VEHICLES</h3><ul><li><h3>Multigunner IFV:</h3> The IFV is one of the most versatile units in the game. It can load a single infantry, at which point the IFV's main rocket launcher will convert to an upsized version of the infantry's weapon. Loading a peacekeeper equips the IFV with a powerful shotgun for anti-infantry. Loading engineers allows the IFV to repair allied vehicles and loading dogs will turn allow the IFV to stun infantry. In team games, a teammate's infantry from other factions can be loaded into the IFV creating even more possibilities.</li><li><h3>Guardian Tank:</h3> The Guardian tank is the main battle tank for the Allies. It has a good balance of speed, armor, firepower, and range. Its secondary ability toggles a targeting laser that allows allied units to deal 50% more damage to the designated target.</li></ul><ul><li><h3>Prospector:</h3> The Prospector is the ore collector. Its secondary ability is unpacking into an outpost allowing the Allies more build space.</li></ul><ul><li><h3>Athena Cannon:</h3> The Athena is the Allies' artillery unit that fires a powerful orbital laser on its targets. Its secondary ability is the Athena Shield which projects a large forcefield to soak up damage.</li><li><h3>Mirage Tank:</h3> A combination of Red Alert 2's Mirage and Prism Tanks, the Red Alert 3 Mirage Tank is the most advance tank the Allies can field. The Mirage Tank can camouflage with the environment while stationary to become invisible to enemies and is equipped with a Spectrum-Dispersion Cannon that can bounce off multiple nearby targets. Its secondary ability allows it to cloak other allied units within a short range around it.</li></ul><h3>AIRCRAFT</h3><ul><li><h3>Apollo Fighter:</h3> The Apollo is the Allies air superiority fighter, it is more powerful than its Soviet and Empire equivalents. Its secondary ability allows it to fly at great speed straight back to the airbase via the most direct route. Apollos must land in airbases to resupply ammo.</li></ul><ul><li><h3>Century Bomber:</h3> The Century Bomber; the Allies main bomber aircraft can carpet bomb large areas and can also be loaded with infantry to be parachuted down anywhere. Centuries must land in an airbase to resupply.</li></ul><ul><li><h3>Cryocopter:</h3> The Cryocopter can freeze any unit or building with its main gun--the more health the target has, the longer it takes to freeze. Frozen units and structures will die in one hit from any source. The Cryocopter's secondary ability is the Shrink Ray, which will reduce one target--friendly or enemy--to miniscule proportions for 15 seconds. Shrunken units do significantly less damage while also taking more damage; however, they move much faster.</li><li><h3>Vindicator:</h3> The Vindicator essentially replaces the Harrier Jet from Red Alert 2 as a strike-and-return, pinpoint bomber. Its secondary ability orders it to fly back to base at increased speed along the most direct route. Vindicators must land in an airbase to resupply.</li></ul><h3>NAVAL</h3><ul><li><h3>Riptide ACV</h3> The Riptide ACV is an early Allied amphibious transport unit that can carry 5 infantry units. On water it fires torpedoes while on land it uses a machine gun.</li><li><h3>Dolphin:</h3> The Dolphin is the Allies' fast, water-based scout unit. It attacks via amplified sonar pulses that do linear splash damage. Its secondary ability allows it to briefly jump out of the water to avoid attack or leap over obstacles, but leaves it temporarily vulnerable to anti-air attacks.</li><li><h3>Hydrofoil:</h3> The Hydrofoil is the main Allied anti-air naval unit. It is a very fast unit with dual rapid-firing chainguns that shred aircraft in seconds. Its secondary ability allows it to selectively target and disable the weapons of any nearby enemy non-infantry unit.</li><li><h3>Assault Destroyer:</h3> The Assault Destroyer is the most powerful amphibious unit in the game. In addition to its beefy main cannon, it can activate a blackhole shield draws all nearby enemy fire to it, protecting enveloped allied units from attacks.</li></ul><ul><li><h3>Aircraft Carrier:</h3> The Aircraft Carrier is the main naval siege unit for the Allies. It deploys five powerful drones that bomb ground targets at great distance. While in flight to or from their target, the drones are susceptible to anti-air attacks, and any destroyed drones are automatically replenished by the aircraft carrier after a short time for free. The carrier's secondary ability fires a Blackout Missile that powers down all enemy units and structures within the area of the point of impact.</li></ul><h3><b>SOVIETS</b></h3><h3>INFANTRY</h3><ul><li><h3>War Bear:</h3> The War Bear acts as an early game scout with the same abilities as the Allied Attack Dog. Though not as fast as the Allied Attack Dog, the Bear has more health.</li><li><h3>Conscript:</h3> The Conscript is the basic Soviet infantry unit. He is lightly effective against all other infantry, and not much else. His secondary ability is to throw a stream of Molotov cocktails which deals small splash damage and can clear out enemy garrisoned buildings.</li><li><h3>Flak Trooper:</h3> The Flak Trooper is the main anti-air and armor unit. Its secondary ability is to throw down a magnetic mine that latches onto enemy vehicles or structures and deals significant damage.</li><li><h3>Combat Engineer:</h3> The Combat Engineer can capture enemy or neutral tech buildings. It is the only engineer to have a weapon - a pistol. Combat Engineers can deploy mini bunkers fit for two infantry. Also can deploy a one-man inflatable raft to allow him to cross water.</li><li><h3>Tesla Trooper:</h3> The Tesla Trooper is a powerful anti-infantry and armor unit with a short charge-up time to its attacks. Its secondary ability emits an area discharge that disables nearby enemy vehicles. It can also charge up friendly Tesla Coils by firing at them and cannot be crushed by enemy vehicles.</li><li><h3>Natasha:</h3> Natasha is the Soviet commando. She has a high powered sniper rifle that can pierce multiple infantry. She can call down paint non-infantry targets with a laser designator to call in airstrikes to destroy vehicles and structures. Her secondary ability is to snipe the pilot from a ground vehicle which can then be commandeered by any friendly infantry, effectively trading that infantry unit for permanent control of the captured vehicle.</li></ul><h3>VEHICLES</h3><ul><li><h3>Terror Drone:</h3> The Terror Drone is a fast, but fragile early harassment unit. It jumps into vehicles and slowly dismantles them from the inside. An infested vehicle can only be purged by being repaired (from any source). The Terror Drone's secondary ability is the Stasis Ray which prevents the targeted vehicle from moving, which can be handy to allow another terror drone to catch up to a fleeing vehicle, for example.</li><li><h3>Sickle:</h3> Inspired by the Terror Drone's spider-like design, the Sickle is a multi-legged crawler, with three machine guns around its body that chew through infantry. Its secondary ability allows the Sickle high through the air and land across chasms, atop cliffs, or right into a pack of enemy infantry, stunning and damaging them all.</li><li><h3>Ore Collector:</h3> The Ore Collector collects ore. Its secondary ability allows it to deploy a shield that greatly reduces damage at the cost of movement speed and its ore-collecting ability.</li><li><h3>Bullfrog:</h3> The Bullfrog is the Soviets' early troop transport; it can only attack air units with its flak cannon, leaving it helpless against enemy ground units. Up to 5 infantry can be loaded into the Bullfrog for transport. The only means of unloading its passengers is for the Bullfrog to launch them into the air with its Mancannon. Each launched infantry unit will then parachute to the ground, all the while being vulnerable to anti-air attacks.</li></ul><ul><li><h3>Sputnik:</h3> This is a Soviet base expansion unit. It can be unpacked into an outpost that gives a build radius.</li><li><h3>Hammer Tank:</h3> The Hammer Tank is the main Soviet battle tank. It is more powerful than the Allies' Guardian with more armor at the expense of speed. Its secondary ability is a Leech Beam allowing it to steadily leach health from enemy vehicles. If the leech beam kills the vehicle, the Hammer Tank gains the weapon of that vehicle. A clever tactic is to use the leech beam on allied vehicles that are about to die. This not only prevents the enemy unit from gaining promotion bonuses, but the Hammer Tank also gains a new weapon.</li><li><h3>V4 Rocket Launcher:</h3> The V4 is the Soviet's artillery unit. The V4 fires long range missiles at targets and is quite effective against most units, assuming they stay still long enough for the slow-moving missiles to connect. Its secondary ability allows it to fire cluster missiles that exchange pinpoint damage for reduced area splash damage.</li></ul><ul><li><h3>Apocalypse Tank:</h3></li></ul><p>The Apocalypse Tank is RA3's equivalent to the Mammoth Tank. It is effective against all other armored vehicles. Though slow, the Apocalypse can crush smaller tanks. The Apocalypse's secondary is a Magnetic Harpoon that draws enemy vehicles towards grinders in the tank's front, instantly killing the enemy unit on contact.</p><h3>AIRCRAFT</h3><ul><li><h3>Twinblade:</h3> The Soviets attack helicopter can fire a intermittent barrage of rockets to complement its continuous stream of machine gun fire and can transport up to five infantry units or one vehicle.</li><li><h3>MiG:</h3> The Mig is the Soviet's air superiority fighter. While not as powerful as the Allied Apollo, the MiG deals splash damage, allowing the MiG to come out victorious in large engagements. The secondary ability allows it to fly at a faster rate straight back to the airfield via the most direct route.</li><li><h3>Kirov Airship:</h3> The Kirov's only weakness is its speed. As the slowest unit in the game, it is particularly vulnerable to every form of anti-air. However, should it manage to arrive over a target, that target is all but destroyed as house-sized bombs rain down upon it. The secondary ability allows it to continuously exchange health for movement speed.</li></ul><h3>NAVAL</h3><ul><li><h3>Stingray:</h3> The Stingray is a basic amphibious unit that has a pair of Tesla Coils mounted to its front. It is effective against infantry and lightly armored ships and vehicles. Its secondary ability emits an electrical discharge in the water, damaging every unit around the Stingray and instantly killing biological units like dolphins.</li><li><h3>Akula Sub:</h3> The Akula is the Soviet submersible unit. It is relatively slow, but deals considerable damage. While submerged, the sub can only be attacked by torpedos and advance base defenses. The Akula must surface to attack with its own torpedoes. Its secondary ability fires two unguided Ultra-Torpedoes that deal major damage to anything that fails to get out of their path.</li><li><h3>Dreadnaught:</h3> The Dreadnaught is the Soviet naval siege weapon. It fires three very powerful missles that cannot be shot down and have excellent range. The Dreadnaught's secondary ability increases firing rate but also slowly damages the ship.</li></ul><h3>EMPIRE</h3><h3>INFANTRY</h3><ul><li><h3>Imperial Warrior:</h3></li></ul><p>The main infantry unit of the Empire, the Imperial Warrior is equipped with a laser carbine. Its secondary switches the carbine for a <a href=\"/beam-sword/3055-365/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-365\">beam katana</a>, increasing the Imperial Warrior's speed and lethality to other infantry.</p><ul><li><h3>Tank Buster:</h3></li></ul><p>The Tank Buster, as its name suggests, uses its massive industrial plasma cutter to slice right through armored targets and structures. Busters can also burrow into the ground to prevent being run over as well as drastically reduce incoming damage. However they cannot fire while burrowed.</p><ul><li><h3><b>Shinobi:</b></h3></li></ul><p>The Shinobi is a ninja! Their primary function is the same as that of the Allied Spy, but they are also armed with shurikens and a katana for instantly killing enemy infantry. Their secondary ability drops a smoke bomb, breaking all enemy units' targeting on them.</p><ul><li><h3>Yuriko Omega:</h3></li></ul><p>Yuriko is the Empire's commando unit. She uses her telekinetic powers to lift enemy units into the air and eviscerate them with the power of her mind. Her secondary ability unleashes a psionic shockwave, to damage and knock back all enemy infantry around her. Like all commando units, Yuriko is amphibious (in her case, by means of levitation).</p><ul><li><h3>Rocket Angel:</h3></li></ul><p>Rocket Angels are female shock troopers equipped with exo-skeletal jetpacks that allow them to fly. They are armed with cluster-missile-firing Photon Rocket Launchers, making them good anti-vehicle and air units. Their secondary ability is a Paralysis Whip that disables a ground unit, preventing it from moving and attacking.</p><ul><li><h3>Burst Drone:</h3></li></ul><p>The Burst Drone is a robotic dragonfly used for scouting. It can attach itself to vehicles and slow them down. It can also self destruct to deal light damage. The Drone's advance sensors allow it to detect disguised Spies and Sudden Transports.</p><ul><li><h3>Engineer:</h3></li></ul><p>The Empire's engineer's primary function is the same as the other factions' engineers'. Its secondary ability allows the gangly engineer to sprint for a short period of time, after which he must stop for a moment to catch his breath.</p><h3>VEHICLES</h3><ul><li><h3>Striker/Chopper VX:</h3></li></ul><p>The VX is a bird-like walking mech that can transform into a helicopter. While on the ground it serves as an anti-air vehicle and as a chopper, it is an effective anti-armor unit.</p><ul><li><h3>Tsunami Tank:</h3></li></ul><p>The Tsunami is the standard tank of the Imperial Army. Though not as well armored as the Allied Guardian or the Soviet Hammer, the Tsunami is amphibious. Its secondary ability activates Nano-Deflective Armor that increases the armor and the speed of the tank in exchange for disabling its weapon.</p><ul><li><h3>King Oni:</h3></li></ul><p>The most advanced ground unit in the Empire's arsenal, the King Oni is a terrifying lumbering mech that shoots laser beams out of its eyes.

The game features the entire <a href=\"/the-chronicles-of-riddick-escape-from-butcher-bay/3030-11085/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11085\">Escape From Butcher Bay</a> campaign(which has been improved from the original <a href=\"/xbox/3045-32/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-32\">Xbox</a> version), which can be selected when starting a new game. It isn't required to play through the <a href=\"/butcher-bay/3035-577/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-577\">Butcher Bay</a> portion of the game in order to access the new campaign, Dark Athena.</p><p>The game puts you in the shoes of Riddick, a deadly fugitive who is wanted by every prison and every bounty hunter in the galaxy. The only problem is keeping him locked up. Butcher Bay and its expansion Dark Athena take you through the seedy world of the Butcher Bay jail, aboard the merc ship <a href=\"/dark-athena/3035-2362/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2362\">Dark Athena</a> and across the world of Aguerra where you'll hack, slash and snap the necks of every no good in-mate, guard and solider who gets in your way of freedom.

One of the most important differences is removing the DNA restricted weapons . Though early on in the Dark Athena campaign the player must rely on <a href=\"/melee/3015-444/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-444\">melee</a> or picking up guns attached to the clone enemies.Then, at a certain point weapons can then be picked up and used unlike the first game which required a DNA input.</p><p>The weaponry list (both <a href=\"/projectile/3015-3/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3\">projectile</a> and <a href=\"/melee/3015-444/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-444\">melee</a>) has also expanded and the player has access to a significantly more sophisticated arsenal . Assault on Dark Athena is somewhat less linear than Escape From Butcher Bay. Though the game includes much more shooting action than Butcher Bay which had a more significant amount of <a href=\"/stealth/3015-24/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-24\">stealth</a>.</p><h2>Multiplayer</h2><h3>Team Deathmatch</h3><p>This a standard <a href=\"/team-deathmatch/3015-2463/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2463\">Team Deathmatch</a></p><h3>Pitch Black</h3><p>Named after the first movie featuring Richard Riddick, this mode is similar to the 'Juggernaut' mode in the <a href=\"/halo/3025-2/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-2\">Halo series</a>. In this mode, the map has very little light, most of the players are guards while one is Riddick. Guards are equipped with guns and <a href=\"/flashlight/3055-156/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-156\">flashlights</a> of limited effectiveness, while Riddick is armed with his Ulak blades and can use his Eyeshine ability. Guards must work together to take Riddick down, while he attempts to kill as many guards as he can. If a guard kills Riddick, he immediately respawns <i>as</i> Riddick.</p><h3>Arena</h3><p>Arena is a one-on-one or two-on-two elimination matches inside a small, contained map, with the other players spectating until it's their turn to throw down.</p><h3>Butcher Bay Riot</h3><p>Similar to <a href=\"/counter-strike/3025-114/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-114\">Counter-Strike</a> in that you have a currency at the start of the game to buy weapons, armor and ammo. However the main game is a 3 way fight between Prisoners, Mercenaries and Guards. There is one power-node in the middle the objective is to get the node into your opponents base and each team will have a certain team's base they have to get the node into, for example, Prisoners will have to get the node into the Guards' base the Guards will be after the Mercenaries and the Mercenaries will be after the Prisoners.</p><h2>Trivia</h2><ul><li>The developer team has claimed that Chronicles of Riddick: Assault on Dark Athena is a profoundly long story-driven <a href=\"/first-person-perspective/3015-330/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-330\">first person</a> shooter. Finishing the single player campaign can take somewhere around 20-25 hours.</li></ul><ul><li>The world of Dark Athena is deliberately rude and provocative . Due to <a href=\"/stealth/3015-24/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-24\">stealth</a> nature of the game player can witness or hear assorted things ranging from overhearing conversations on soldier's sexual habits to finding pornography lying around, to supposedly interrupting masturbating guards. The game also features strong language and profanity. The Chronicles of Riddick: Assault on Dark Athena is rated M for mature.</li></ul><h2>Demo</h2><p>There is a playable demo, available now, on the <a href=\"/xbox-live/3015-1404/\"

company's <a href=\"/fabula-nova-crystallis/3025-612/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-612\">Fabula Nova Crystallis</a> project. Originally revealed as a <a href=\"/playstation-3/3045-35/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-35\">PlayStation 3</a> exclusive entitled Final Fantasy Versus XIII, it was later re-announced during <a href=\"/e3-2013/3015-7534/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7534\">E3 2013</a> that its name had changed, and it had become the next game in the core <a href=\"/final-fantasy/3025-194/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-194\">Final Fantasy</a> franchise. It was released worldwide for both the <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/playstation-4/3045-146/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-146\">PlayStation 4</a> and <a href=\"//www.giantbomb.com/xbox-one/3045-145/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-145\">Xbox One</a> on November 29, 2016.</p><h2>Plot</h2><p>The story revolves around a prince, <a href=\"/noctis-lucis-caelum/3005-8162/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-8162\">Noctis Lucis Caelum</a>, who is the heir to the throne of the Kingdom of Lucis. Lucis has become more modernized than other nations, to the point where it resembles a contemporary city of modern Earth<i>.</i> It has isolated itself from the world in the process. The game's setting involves a war between Lucis and another nation called Niflheim as they fight for control of the world's last crystal, which Lucis possesses. The game begins after the end of a long cold war between warring nations and the world's crystals are involved in these conflicts in some way.</p><h2>Characters</h2><h3>Noctis</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2502917\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/56735/2502917-final%20fantasy%20xv.jpg\" data-ratio=\"1.413\" data-width=\"1000\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1000px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:141.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/56735/2502917-final%20fantasy%20xv.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2502917\"><img alt=\"Noctis and his crew.

He is able to wield multiple swords, spears, and lances by materializing them out of thin air and controlling them with telekinesis. His weapons can also be used to block and parry. Noctis also has the ability to teleport and move at high speeds. His eyes change color from blue to red during battle, which is related to his teleportation ability.</p><h3>Noctis' Party</h3><p>Most of Noctis's party consists of his childhood friends: Ignis Stupeo Scientia, a strategist for the royal family who fights with daggers, Gladiolus Amicitia, a bodyguard of the royal family who fights with a giant greatsword, and Prompto Argentum, a foreign fugitive who wields firearms, despite their illegal status in Lucis. Other characters will join and leave the party as the story progresses.</p><h3>Lunafreya</h3><p>Noctis finds a counterpart in Lunafreya Nox Fleuret, a young woman from the enemy empire of Niflheim. She is descended from a long line of Oracles, destined to speak with the Gods of the world. Noctis and Luna are betrothed to marry as the game opens, a union promising peace between their warring nations.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Combat</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2507753\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/99864/2507753-7717677859-FFXV_.png\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"960\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 960px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/99864/2507753-7717677859-FFXV_.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2507753\"><img alt=\"Gladiolus shields Noctis from an enemy monster\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/9/99864/2507753-7717677859-FFXV_.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/99864/2507753-7717677859-FFXV_.png 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/99864/2507753-7717677859-FFXV_.png 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/9/99864/2507753-7717677859-FFXV_.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Gladiolus shields Noctis from an enemy monster\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/9/99864/2507753-7717677859-FFXV_.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/99864/2507753-7717677859-FFXV_.png 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/99864/2507753-7717677859-FFXV_.png 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/9/99864/2507753-7717677859-FFXV_.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Gladiolus shields Noctis from an enemy monster</figcaption></figure><p>The player has direct control over one character, Noctis, with assistance from AI companion party members. Party members can also team up for more powerful attacks.</p><p>When a characters HP reaches zero they enter a downed state, their maximum HP ceiling decreasing until they are healed. When a character's maximum HP hits zero they are considered to be fallen and can only be revived with a Phoenix Down. Noctis has a chance to revive himself in this state via a time freeze, allowing the player to continue play as long as they have a revival item in their inventory. Once Noctis dies and cannot be revived, the game is over.</p><h3>Transportation</h3><p>The primary mode of travel around the game's world is a luxury car called the Regalia. There is much to see off-road however, and the player must rely on traveling by foot or by chocobo to explore the deeper world. The player is able to drive the car manually, or can set driving to automatic. When driving being automatically controlled by the game, the player can still stop to look around the world for secrets and even buy and sell items. The Regalia also features a music player featuring original tunes, songs from Kingsglaive and Brotherhood, and even soundtracks from the entire Final Fantasy series which can be purchased at shops in-game.</p><h3>Teleportation Power</h3><p>Noctis has a special teleportation ability that allows him to warp between select points in the environment. When a cursor highlights a visible location that Noctis can warp to, the player can make him teleport to that spot.</p><h2>Development</h2><p>Final Fantasy XV was first announced under the name of Final Fantasy Versus XIII in 2006. Helmed by <a href=\"/tetsuya-nomura/3040-637/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-637\">Tetsuya Nomura</a>, the intent was to create an <a href=\"/action-rpg/3015-8592/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-8592\">action RPG</a> in the vein of <a href=\"/kingdom-hearts/3025-414/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-414\">Kingdom Hearts</a>, but with a more mature tone and story. The game's title \"Versus XIII\" was meant to reference a number of elements, such as the game's darker tone and setting that play in opposition to the tone and setting of <a href=\"/final-fantasy-xiii/3030-20664/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20664\">Final Fantasy XIII</a>. Versus XIII was developed as a part of the <a href=\"/fabula-nova-crystallis/3025-612/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-612\">Fabula Nova Crystallis</a> project, along with Final Fantasy XIII and <a href=\"/final-fantasy-type-0/3030-21848/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21848\">Final Fantasy Type-0</a> (originally entitled Final Fantasy Agito XIII), and shares elements of the same fictional mythology from which the other games take their own.</p><p>After years of protracted development, Square Enix unveiled a new trailer for Versus XIII at <a href=\"/e3-2013/3015-7534/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7534\">E3 2013</a>, where it was first revealed that the game had become Final Fantasy XV. The following year, at <a href=\"/tokyo-game-show-2014/3015-8511/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-8511\">TGS 2014</a>, Square Enix announced that Nomura had shifted off of the project to focus on <a href=\"/kingdom-hearts-iii/3030-42926/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-42926\">Kingdom Hearts III</a>, and that Final Fantasy Type-0 director <a href=\"/hajime-tabata/3040-94186/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-94186\">Hajime Tabata</a> is now overseeing the game's development. Tabata originally joined the Final Fantasy XV team as co-director in 2012, after which the game began its transition from Versus XIII to XV and development was moved to newer console platforms. Additionally, the three core gameplay, engine, and cinematics teams that had been working separately on Versus XIII, were merged for better collaboration. As of TGS 2014, the Final Fantasy XV team was around three hundred people.</p><h3>Luminous Studio Engine</h3><p>The game is running on Square Enix's <a href=\"/luminous-engine/3015-7696/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7696\">Luminous Studio</a> graphics engine. The demo will be using version 1.5 of the engine, while the final game will be using version 2.0 of the engine. It will be running at 1080p with 30 frames per second. Compared to the 20,000 polygons used for the <a href=\"/fabula-nova-crystallis/3025-612/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-612\">Final Fantasy XIII</a> characters, Final Fantasy XV will be using 100,000 polygons for its characters (around the same as <a href=\"/the-order-1886/3030-42922/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-42922\">The Order: 1886</a>, <a href=\"/uncharted-4-a-thiefs-end/3030-44507/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-44507\">Uncharted 4</a>, and <a href=\"/star-citizen/3030-40011/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-40011\">Star Citizen</a>, but slightly less than <a href=\"/ninja-gaiden-3-razors-edge/3030-39749/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-39749\">Ninja Gaiden 3: Razor's Edge</a> and <a href=\"/infamous-second-son/3030-41695/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-41695\">inFamous: Second Son</a>). Overall, Final Fantasy XV will be using 5 million polygons per frame, pushing 150 million polygons per second.

The demo released on March 20, 2015 called Final Fantasy XV: Episode Duscae. The demo is taken from an early portion of the full game with some differences; the name \"Duscae\" is taken from a location in the game's world. The developers were aiming to allow the demo to be completed in an hour, but it could contain enough optional content to explore to extend to three hours.</p><p>Another demo, Platinum Demo - Final Fantasy XV, was released on March 31, 2016 following the Uncovered: Final Fantasy XV event.

"<h2>Overview</h2><p>The Last Remnant is a role-playing game developed and published by <a href=\"/square-enix/3010-104/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-104\">Square Enix</a> that debuted simultaneously worldwide on the Xbox 360 on November 20th, 2008, the PC on April 9th, 2009. There were plans to release a PlayStation 3 version, but it was never released.</p><p>Directed by <a href=\"/hiroshi-takai/3040-5502/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-5502\">Hiroshi Takai</a> ( <a href=\"/romancing-saga/3030-1368/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1368\">Romancing Saga</a>, <a href=\"/the-bouncer/3030-11814/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11814\">The Bouncer</a>), The Last Remnant is the first Square Enix title that utilizes <a href=\"/epic-games/3010-149/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-149\">Epic's</a> <a href=\"/unreal-engine-3/3015-86/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-86\">Unreal Engine 3</a>. Developed specifically to appeal to both the Eastern and Western gaming markets -- featuring two very different characters with characteristics that appeal to gamers on both sides of the globe, the protagonist designed to appeal to Eastern consumers, one of his companions to Western -- The Last Remnant is the first Square Enix game to be simultaneously released in Japan, Europe and North America.</p><h2>Setting</h2><p>The Last Remnant is set in a fictional world featuring a number of distinct humanoid races; the Mitra, most human in appearance, the Yama, strong fish-like people, the Qsiti, small reptilians, and the Sovanni, feline people with four arms and a rabbit-like creature (the name of this creature is currently unknown). The story of the game revolves around \"remnants\", mysterious and coveted ancient artifacts of varying shapes and sizes which possess magic powers and which have been the cause of several wars throughout the game's history. Rush Sykes is the protagonist of the story, the son of two established Remnant researchers whose sister Irina is kidnapped, sparking the story's initial plot development. He is supported by the Marquis of Athlum, David Nassau, and accompanied by four generals: Emma, Torgal, Blocter and Pagus. A mysterious man known as The Conqueror also figures prominently in the game's plot, a powerful warlord whose aggressive tendencies and surprising power over Remnants creates a shift in the balance of power within the governing Congress in Elysion.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>The Last Remnant is a strategy RPG in which the player must manage a party consisting of multiple units segmented into groups (called Unions). While following the central plot and/or completing quests, the player sets his/her Unions against AI Unions in battle.</p><p>Navigation takes place via world and city map screens, with locations becoming available as the story progresses or as quests are accepted. Each city contains a Pub where quests can be found, and a Guild where Leaders can be recruited and Guild Tasks can be completed. Completion of quests often makes new Leaders become available at the Guilds. Unions are built around both story Leaders (i.e. Rush, David, etc), and Leaders found at Guilds. There is a limit to the number of Leaders that can be in a Union at any one time, so they are supplemented with recruit-able Athlumiam soldiers to make up the numbers. Unions are assigned a minimum of one Leader and up to four other units, as well as having a formation that affects the attributes of the Union.</p><p>Party members other than Rush can not be directly customized. Their skill choices and equipment are handled directly by the game. The player can influence them indirectly though, as they must request items with which to improve their equipment and will often ask how they should focus their development in general terms as well as if they should bother with specific skill choices.</p><h3>Battle System</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3948/220562-939443_20080716_screen004.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-220562\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3948/220562-939443_20080716_screen004.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-220562\"><img alt=\"Selecting a Union command during battle.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3948/220562-939443_20080716_screen004.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3948/220562-939443_20080716_screen004.jpg 1280w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/3948/220562-939443_20080716_screen004.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3948/220562-939443_20080716_screen004.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>Selecting a Union command during battle.</figcaption></figure><p>The Last Remnant features a turn based strategy battle system termed by director Hiroshi Takai as a \"Turn-burst, command-based system using symbol encounters.\" The system is a hybrid between a turn-based command system (i.e. Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest) and a turn-based strategy system. Unlike most other strategy RPGs it does not use a grid-based system.</p><p>Battles begin when enemies that roam the field maps/dungeons either attack Rush or are drawn into battle with the Right Trigger, which pulls enemies from within a radius. The Right Bumper activates a Timeshift ability that slows down all time except for Rush's movement. While in Timeshift, the player can run around and tag enemies. Pressing the Right Trigger while still in Timeshift and having tagged some enemies pulls all of them into battle. Typically, the more enemies tagged, the harder the challenge but the greater the rewards.</p><p>Commands are issued to the Unions the player has constructed, with the commands available being dependent on the Union's member units as well as various battle conditions. The use of skills (referred to as Arts) is influenced by an AP counter shared by all units comprising a Union, meaning less AP will allow fewer units to perform a skill when a command is selected. Typically the leader of a Union will always have access to the AP pool for Arts before the other units, the only exception being when the leader doesn't have an Art that meets the criteria (e.g. Selecting a healing command when the leader doesn't possess any healing Arts.)</p><p>Unions share more than their AP, they also share HP. The HP of the member units are totaled to give the Union's HP. In order for the player to kill (referred to as Terminate) an enemy Union, or vice-versa, they must deplete its total HP. When Unions are engaged in combat, each unit will target another unit at random, either attacking or using its selected Art. Arts that target all units of a Union also exist. Individual units can be killed (referred to as Incapacitated) which has the effect of reducing the Unions capabilities. If the leader of a Union is Incapacitated then the Union is Botched, which causes it to stop receiving commands from the player. The damage dealt to a unit can exceed its maximum HP, resulting in an Overkill. Any extra damage beyond the limit of a single units HP counts towards the damage the Union receives. This means that attacking a single unit can result in Termination of the entire Union if the damage dealt is sufficient.</p><p>During a battle multiple Unions, both player and enemy, are usually present. When selecting Union commands the player must first select a target Union. The enemy Unions will also select targets which are unknown to the player. Once all Unions have received a target and command the Unions each approach their target in order and engage them in a Deadlock. Depending on the order in which the Unions act, the players Unions may not engage their target Unions, and vice-versa. Attempts to engage the enemy can be Intercepted if another Union engages first.</p><p>The following is a list of different types of Deadlock and the conditions that cause them to occur:</p><blockquote><p>Deadlock - This is the standard Deadlock type. Occurs when Unions meet within melee range.</p><p>Raidlock - Occurs when forcing a Union into Deadlock from a distance. Damage dealt is increased for the offensive Union.</p><p>Flank Attack - Occurs when engaging a Union that is already Deadlocked with another Union. Damage dealt is increased for the offensive Union, and the defensive Union can not Attack or use Arts.</p><p>Rear Assault - Occurs when engaging a Union that is already in Deadlock with another Union and flanked by two other Unions. Damage dealt is increased for the offensive Union, and the and the defensive Union can not Attack or use Arts.</p><p>Interference - Occurs when forcing Deadlock on an enemy Union that was targeting another ally Union.</p><p>Interception - Occurs when the enemy forces Deadlock on a player Union that was targeting another enemy Union.</p><p>Massive Strike - Occurs when engaging a Union that is already in Deadlock with another Union, flanked by two other Unions, and in Rear Assault by another Union. Damage dealt is massively increased for the offensive Union.</p><p>Multi-Deadlock - Occurs in place of a Flank Attack when attacking some boss Unions. It allows them to have regular Deadlock with more than one Union and does not prevent Attacks, Arts, or add any damage bonus to either Union.</p></blockquote><p>Timed button presses are an important feature of the game. They offer the ability to sometimes counter-attack should a unit dodge an incoming attack, as well as the ability to deal extra damage and bump up allied units in the turn order. The required button could be either A, B, X, Y, or the Right Trigger (Xbox 360 version) as well as being timed differently each time they occur. A circle shrinks around a graphic of the button to be pressed, and the player must press that button when the circle is lined up and scaled to the graphic. This feature can be turned off in the options.</p><h2>Reception and PC Release</h2><p>The Last Remnant's North American release was met with mediocre reviews and a tidal wave of complaints centered around the game's graphical performance. The use of Unreal Engine 3 led to serious performance issues and the original release was plagued by slowdown and poor frame rates. The PC release of the game in early 2009 was received with much more enthusiasm and solves many of the performance issues that came with the 360 release.</p><h3>Differences on the PC version</h3><p>There were several other changes made to the PC release that resulted in a far more palatable game. Some of the most notable changes include:</p><ul><li>New game plus mode that carries over many of the player's acquired collectibles and offers a Hard Mode to seasoned players.</li><li>New formations, items, and the ability to preview the visual appearance of items before purchasing or creating them.</li><li>No leader limit, new classes and far more customizable leader units.</li><li>Slight changes to existing quests and DLC content.</li><li>Autosave feature and more opportunities to save in important areas.</li></ul><h2>Soundtrack</h2><h3>Disc One</h3><table><tbody><tr><td>01.</td><td>The First

However, his success was thanks largely to the machinations of Braniac, who had slowly been draining Earth's protectors of their powers, and eventually conquers all of Earth.</p><p>Future Lex time-travels to the present, and tells the still intact Justice League the fate of their planet, and his plan to avert it: by releasing nanites created from the powers of the heroes in the future by Braniac. Future Lex infects much of the population of Earth with new superpowers to swell the ranks of meta-humans for the coming Brainiac invasion.</p><p>As one of the new superheroes (or villains), you escape Brainiac's harvester ships with the help of either Oracle and Superman or Calculator and Lex Luthor, and go on to be mentored in the ways of justice or evil.</p><p>If you choose to be a hero, your mentor will be either Superman, Wonder Woman, or Batman. For the villain side, your mentor will be Lex Luthor, Circe, or the Joker. You will also begin the game in your mentor's respective home turf (eg Metropolis if Superman or Lex), where the battle between good and evil, heightened by the influx of new Metas, rages on every street corner.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2748/272615-2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-272615\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2748/272615-2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-272615\"><img alt=\"Not only can objects be thrown and used as melee weapons, but also they can be charged up and even deflected.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2748/272615-2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2748/272615-2.jpg 1280w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/2748/272615-2.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2748/272615-2.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2748/272615-2.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Not only can objects be thrown and used as melee weapons, but also they can be charged up and even deflected.</figcaption></figure><p>The gameplay is more action oriented than most MMORPGs. You begin with selecting your character's customized stats and look. You can then choose your super power like fire, lightning, etc. You can then chose your power source (for example your fists if it's a Batman-like character or a bow and arrow for a Green Arrow type character) and your movement style like super speed, flight, acrobatics, etc. Combined with traits like super strength or metabolism, you can mix and match many of these gameplay choices and create any type of superhero you want (weapons are also available for your character but are based on whether they are ranged or close-quarter combat items). You get different abilities as you level up like in most traditional MMORPGs (the two types of points that you invest in your character's abilities are skill points and power points). The more you invest towards your hero/villain's skill will cause the effectiveness of that skill to increase (telekinesis for example has a greater range and damage as it is upgraded). Depending on the skills you have, you can climb walls, run fast, jump really high, etc. There are no classes in the game because every aspect of the character is customizable and because superheroes are very adaptable (in the game you can change from an offensive role to defensive role on the fly, affecting the abilities you have). One ability might be used to deal damage but when switched to defensive mode that power is used to knock opponents down.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19745/899387-dc_scr_env_metro_0041.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-899387\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.5634765625\" data-width=\"1024\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19745/899387-dc_scr_env_metro_0041.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-899387\"><img alt=\"Places from the DC Universe, like Metropolis, will be fully explorable right down to the Daily Planet.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/19745/899387-dc_scr_env_metro_0041.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19745/899387-dc_scr_env_metro_0041.jpg 1024w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/19745/899387-dc_scr_env_metro_0041.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/19745/899387-dc_scr_env_metro_0041.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/19745/899387-dc_scr_env_metro_0041.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Places from the DC Universe, like Metropolis, will be fully explorable right down to the Daily Planet.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/19745/899387-dc_scr_env_metro_0041.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19745/899387-dc_scr_env_metro_0041.jpg 1024w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/19745/899387-dc_scr_env_metro_0041.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/19745/899387-dc_scr_env_metro_0041.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/19745/899387-dc_scr_env_metro_0041.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Places from the DC Universe, like Metropolis, will be fully explorable right down to the Daily Planet.</figcaption></figure><p>It seems that instead of the traditional \"Quests\" you have \"cases\". This is where you must provide a wide range of help to the other legendary superheroes like Superman or Batman. For example, Batman may call you on your communicator to meet him at the docks for help. Also, he will be disappointed and make a remark pertaining to your absence if you didn't show up. You will have a relationship with these characters and they will respond accordingly to your actions and choices. Another example of a case would be that you arrive in Metropolis, one of the fully fleshed and explorable cities/areas in the game, where you must prevent Doomsday from escaping after a huge fight with Superman. Your case would be to stop Lex Luthor's forces from obtaining some of the blood that spilled during the battle. You will be in contact with these superheroes throughout your career. If you play as the villain you will get \"Capers\" where you work for the villians. So you will actually be fighting other players who are working for the superheroes on the same mission objectives.</p><p>The action is not turn based or random; it's all 100% responsive to your button commands like a standard action game.</p><p>There is no death in the game, just Knockouts. Instead you can choose to rally back into the fight or withdraw. You can revive unconscious NPCs and other players so that they can help you if and/or when the need arises.</p><h3>Powers</h3><p>Players are given the option to setup the powers of their superhero during the initial creation of their character. Powers basically determine what kind of combat abilities they will have and their specific role type. Within each powers skill tree, players have two paths to allocate their points. Powers are currently broken up into:</p><p><b><u>Fire</u></b></p><ul><li>Immolation</li><li>Ignition</li></ul><p><b><u>Ice</u></b></p><ul><li>Cryogenics</li><li>Storm</li></ul><p><b><u>Mental</u></b></p><ul><li>Telekinesis</li><li>Illusion</li></ul><p><b><u>Nature</u></b></p><ul><li>Shape shifting</li><li>Plants</li></ul><p><b><u>Sorcery</u></b></p><ul><li>Summoning</li><li>Destiny</li></ul><p><b><u>Gadgets</u></b></p><ul><li>Tricks</li><li>Traps</li></ul><p><b><u>Light</u></b></p><ul><li>Support</li><li>Assault</li></ul><p><b><u>Electricity</u></b></p><ul><li>Voltage</li><li>Amperage</li></ul><p><b><u>Earth</u></b></p><ul><li>Geokinesis</li><li>Seismic</li></ul><p><b><u>Quantum</u></b></p><ul><li>Time</li><li>Space</li></ul><h3>Weapons</h3><p>Weapons determine your basic form of combat. Depending on what type of weapons you choose will determine if your character deals damage up close or from a far. At first players are only allowed to choose one type of weapon skill to learn but after they reach level 10 they can choose from the others available.</p><p>At the moment the weapon types are:</p><ul><li>One-Handed</li><li>Two-Handed</li><li>Hand Blaster</li><li>Bow</li><li>Brawling</li><li>Dual Pistols</li><li>Dual Wield</li><li>Martial Arts</li><li>Rifle</li><li>Staff</li></ul><h2>Pricing</h2><p>The <a href=\"../../playstation-3/60-35/\" rel=\"nofollow\">PS3</a> version of the game originally retailed for $59.99 while the <a href=\"../../pc/60-94/\" rel=\"nofollow\">PC</a> version originally retailed for $49.99. Both versions come with one free month of play time. The game originally followed the standard a $15/month subscription-based model until October 2011 when a free-to-play model was unveiled. There are three \"tiers:\" Free, Premium and Legendary. The Legendary subscription will retain the $15 a month fee but grants all current and future DLC at no additional cost, more than 15 character slots, more than 80 inventory slots, the ability to form leagues without any size restrictions, and more.</p><h2>DLC Packs</h2><h3>Fight for the Light</h3><p>The first DLC pack released on September 6, 2011.

Much like its spiritual predecessor <a data-ref-id=\"3030-15849\" href=\"/flow/3030-15849/\">flOw</a>, flower is much less about the gameplay than it is about a different meaning of a game.</p><p>thatgamecompany's co-founder, <a data-ref-id=\"3040-82903\" href=\"/jenova-chen/3040-82903/\">Jenova Chen</a>, has described it as being like \"video game poetry.\" It is not too difficult to interpret there being an environmental message behind the game, or at least a contrast to urban living being explored. Bringing unique elements yet to be seen in this generation of consoles, flower has gained a dedicated following.</p><h3>Inspiration</h3><p>In <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9y6MYDSAww\" rel=\"nofollow\">a TED talk about \"Are Video Games Art?\"</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3040-98025\" href=\"/kellee-santiago/3040-98025/\">Kellee Santiago</a> of <a data-ref-id=\"3010-5521\" href=\"/thatgamecompany/3010-5521/\">thatgamecompany</a>, said the game was \"<strong>an expression of director,</strong> <a data-ref-id=\"3040-82903\" href=\"/jenova-chen/3040-82903/\"><strong>Jenova Chen</strong></a><strong>, who moved from the extremely metropolitan area of Shanghai, China to the relatively more rural area of California. He was just amazed at these huge rolling landscapes, and yet he found over time, he started to miss those elements of the city he grew up with. And so although it starts in these very open, clean environments; as the player goes through the game, they realise it's about trying to find a harmony or balance between the elements of urban and the natural</strong>.\"</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Essentially, the player controls the wind. The gameplay involves guiding a stream of petals around various landscapes in which you will be able to interact with the flowers there in some way, depending on the particular level. All motion in the game is designed to be controlled using the SIXAXIS functionality of the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-35\" href=\"/playstation-3/3045-35/\">PlayStation 3</a> controller. The creators are trying to immerse the player in another experience when playing flower, which they are trying to achieve by the use of stunning visuals complemented by a soothing musical score, and with the field of vision in the game being wider than in most games to better mimic a human's peripheral vision and depth perception. The visual fidelity of Flower is in large part due to the game being able to render and simulate 200,000 blades of grass on-screen at any one time, surely allowing it to claim the coveted boast of the 'best grass in video games...ever'. The only use of the buttons in gameplay is holding any button to accelerate.</p><h3>Hidden/Secret Flowers</h3><p>Each level contains three groups of secret flowers, some of which are activated by blooming certain flowers in a particular area and others are hidden from the path the game leads you through. Each batch collected leaves a seed in the pot of your flower in the menu upon completion of the level. Each seed you collect will also make your flower at the menu open up to a more full bloom. Obtaining all three secret flower groups for all six levels will grant you the Dream gold trophy, which will also change the default view from the apartment, this view replaces the urban environment with a sunny field in the foreground and a grassy hill in the background. This is thought to show that the flowers' dream has come true.</p><h2>Level design</h2><p>It would seem that the main menu in flower, from which each level is loaded, is based around an urban apartment. The different levels are said to be the 'dreams' of different flowers that are represented in this apartment. The flowers appear in the following order when all the levels are unlocked: Pink, Red, Yellow, Blue, Purple, White. Every single flower level adds something unique or introduces a new type of flower.</p><h3>Pink Flower</h3><p>Gazing into this flower opens a wind based level. Players are introduced to the blue flowers which make wind blow to power up the many windmills. Afterwords player traverse a canyon until they gain more speed and end up powering more windmills.</p><h3>Red Flower</h3><p>This is the second level you unlock. It is a color based level that starts in sepia tones. When you unleash the power of the red flowers color starts popping into the world. In the final area you can gain the power to color grass by touching different stones.</p><h3>Yellow Flower</h3><p>The first level focuses on introducing the basic flower mechanics. Grabbing yellow flowers makes red flowers spawn, and red flowers renew and reinvigorate the area around them turning it green and filled with life.</p><h3>Blue Flower</h3><p>Using windmills to create electricity and illuminate the ground at nighttime is the new mechanic presented here. Here you are able to \"charge\" electrically the petals that follow you and transmit electricity from lamp post to lamp post until you finish the level.</p><h3>Purple Flower</h3><p>The dreariest level in the game, you must reach the end while nullifying the threatening electrical power grids, that can burn you and hurt you. Culminates with a dash and dodging of falling debris and is apparently directly connected to the final level.</p><h3>White Flower</h3><p>This is the final level, the new mechanic introduced is renovating the world, at the beginning the petals become super charged similar to when you could color the grass in the red color level. You now have the power to eliminate the corruption in the city, and renovate it and repaint it into a vibrant and beautiful place once more.</p><p>Each dream/level is based on an aspect of urban life with flower presumably showing a contrast to that within the level. So, for example, one level will be based on color, with the game world initially starting out as desaturated and gray like in most urban landscapes, but with progressively more color coming into the landscape as you interact with it. There are six levels in total, plus the credits level.</p><h2>Awards</h2><p>In addition to being critically well received, flower won numerous awards including</p><ul><li>Best Indie Game - Playboy</li><li>Best Original Soundtrack - X-Play</li><li>Best Independent Game of the Year - SpikeTV Video Game Awards</li><li>Best Downloadable Game of the Year - TheSixthAxis</li><li>Download Game of the Year - 1UP</li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3015-3244\" href=\"/e3-2009/3015-3244/\">E3</a> Gold Award - <a data-ref-id=\"3010-3694\" href=\"/gamepro/3010-3694/\">GamePro</a></li><li>Best Downloadable Game - GameSpy</li><li>PS3 Special Achievement for Innovation - IGN</li><li>Best Original Game - UGO</li><li>Casual Game of the Year - AIAS</li><li>Oh, and <a data-ref-id=\"3040-44184\" href=\"/david-jaffe/3040-44184/\">David Jaffe</a> called flower his Game of the Year.

In order to clear an area, the main missions for that area must be completed and the EDF's control must be reduced to zero. Control can be reduced by two means; Destroying EDF buildings or by completing Guerrilla Actions.</p><p>There are various Guerrilla Actions:</p><ul><li><b>House Arrest</b> - The player must rescue hostages from the EDF and return them to base.</li><li><b>Guerrilla Raid</b> -The player is tasked with aiding the Red Faction in ridding an area of EDF soldiers.

The morale meter determines how well the population supports Mason and how willing they are to fight the EDF. A higher morale means more support from fellow Red Faction members during confrontations with the EDF, and a higher salvage bonus upon the completion of story missions. Morale can be raised by destroying propaganda, completing actions, completing missions, and by killing a large amount of EDF troops. However, morale can be lost by the deaths of friendly troops and innocent civilians, either by Mason's hands or by the EDF's hands. Morale is also lost each time the player dies.</p><p>Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, is the collection of salvage. Salvage functions as the currency of the Red Faction, and is implied to hold great value on Mars due to lack of resources. The salvage collected will go towards the purchasing of new weapons and upgrades at a safe house. New equipment and upgrades unlock as the player progresses through the game and completes guerrilla actions. There are four main sources of salvage: story missions, guerrilla actions, EDF vehicles, and EDF property. While not all EDF property will drop salvage, any property that is NOT owned by the EDF will never leave salvage behind when destroyed (except for propane tanks and other explosives).</p><p>During the single player campaign, players are able to find various collectibles/destructibles. These include:</p><ul><li><b>Ore Deposits</b> - there are 300 of these spread across the in-game world. They are shown as orange dots on the minimap. Destroying an ore mine rewards the player with a small amount of salvage points. Mining every ore in the game unlocks the Working the Land achievement/trophy.</li><li><b>Radio Tags</b> - there are 36 hidden radio tags to find in the in-game world. They are shown as green dots on the minimap. Upon collecting a radio tag, the player will hear a short audio message played. For every 3 tags collected, a M.O.A.B. is generated and it's location is marked on the map. Collect all of them to unlock the Lost Memories achievement/trophy.</li><li><b>Propaganda Signs</b> - there are 50 of these signs to find in the game. They're usually found alongside roads and are quite easy to spot. Upon destroying a sign, the player will gain a small morale boost in that particular sector. Destroy them all to unlock the Free Your Mind achievement/trophy.</li></ul><h2>Levels</h2><p><b>Parker</b></p><ul><li>Better Red Than Dead</li><li>Ambush</li><li>Start Your Engines</li></ul><p><b>Dust</b></p><ul><li>Ultor Echo</li><li>Rallying Point</li><li>Industrial Revolution</li></ul><p><b>Badlands</b></p><ul><li>Access Denied</li><li>Catch and Release</li><li>Emergency Response</li><li>Air Traffic Control</li></ul><p><b>Oasis</b></p><ul><li>Blitzbrieg</li></ul><p><b>Freefire Zone</b></p><ul><li>The Guns of Tharsis</li></ul><p>E<b>os</b></p><ul><li>The Dogs of War</li><li>Death by Committee</li><li>Hammer of the Gods</li><li>Meeting the Marauders</li><li>Emergency Broadcast System</li><li>Manual Override</li><li>Guerrillas at the Gates</li><li>Mars Attacks</li></ul><h2>Multiplayer</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8812/457574-screen1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-457574\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"800\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8812/457574-screen1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-457574\"><img alt=\"Multiplayer is different from the single-player experience.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/8812/457574-screen1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8812/457574-screen1.jpg 800w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/8812/457574-screen1.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Multiplayer is different from the single-player experience.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/8812/457574-screen1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8812/457574-screen1.jpg 800w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/8812/457574-screen1.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Multiplayer is different from the single-player experience.</figcaption></figure><p>The multiplayer component focuses on the absolute destruction aspect of the game.

Once there, they are shown who they will be playing with, the current map, and the settings of the match. The game often changes up the settings to provide a new experience. For example, the player could find himself in a match where the health has been lowered, friendly fire has been turned on, and unlimited ammo is activated. The game also changes up the starting equipment, so players could start the match with powerful weapons or a sledgehammer and nothing else.</p><p>The player is able to earn <a href=\"/experience-points/3015-39/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-39\">experience points</a> during each match. When a game ends, the player is shown a stats screen that shows them how well (or bad) they did, and also shows a bar that fills up with the points they earned. If it completely fills, the player unlocks something. The unlocks come in the form of new characters to play as, new game modes, new sledgehammers, and/or bonus XP events. The bonus XP events occur when the player does something unique during a match. Bonus XP events can include killing the top player on the other team, killing enemies without a backpack equipped, recovering to full health after being near death, and much more.</p><h3>Modes</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1104410-944786_20080801_embed001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1104410\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.56279069767442\" data-width=\"430\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 430px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1104410-944786_20080801_embed001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1104410\"><img alt=\"Damage Control is one of the many multiplayer modes.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/1104410-944786_20080801_embed001.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1104410-944786_20080801_embed001.jpg 430w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/1104410-944786_20080801_embed001.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Damage Control is one of the many multiplayer modes.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/1104410-944786_20080801_embed001.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1104410-944786_20080801_embed001.jpg 430w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/1104410-944786_20080801_embed001.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Damage Control is one of the many multiplayer modes.</figcaption></figure><ul><li><b>Anarchy</b> - Anarchy is a free-for-all <a href=\"/deathmatch/3015-451/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-451\">deathmatch mode</a> which pits all players against each other in one of many maps. Depending on the options chosen, the leader for the match may be highlighted. In addition, this is one of the few modes where players aren't put into teams (Red Faction, EDF, etc.), but instead display whichever character they chose for that type.</li><li><b>Team Anarchy</b> - The same basic mechanics of Anarchy apply in Team Anarchy, except players are split into two teams for a <a href=\"/team-deathmatch/3015-2463/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2463\">team deathmatch</a>. In Team Anarchy, there is no leader highlighting, and characters are now split into factions rather than playing as a certain character.</li><li><b>Capture the Flag</b> - A traditional <a href=\"/capture-the-flag/3015-25/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-25\">capture the flag mode</a> that is seen in many modern shooters. Once the enemy's flag is retrieved, it must be returned to the opposing base. If the player's own flag is missing, the enemy's flag cannot be captured. Various customizable options appear only in this mode, such as returning flag upon touch and how long a flag stays after being dropped (five seconds to a minute).</li><li><b>Damage Control</b> - Damage Control is a unique twist on the <a href=\"/conquest-mode/3015-1099/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1099\">conquest</a> game mode. In each map, there are three control points. Players are given the Reconstructor (a weapon which can literally rebuild structures) and must reconstruct the control points for their team. Enemy control points first must be destroyed, and then recaptured using the Reconstructor.</li><li><b>Demolition</b> - In Demolition, one player on each team is designated as the Destroyer, and then must destroy everything in sight, gaining points for the team. Killing the enemy Destroyer will delay their destruction for nine seconds, until a new Destroyer is randomly selected.</li><li><b>Siege</b> - Siege is an <a href=\"/assault/3015-3294/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3294\">Assault</a>-type game mode, which splits players into two teams, one attacking and one defending. The defensive team is tasked with protecting several structures, while the offensive team must knock them down (gaining points for their team). This is the longest mode, as it takes twenty minutes rather than ten (each team gets a round). In addition, several maps that Siege takes place on are unique to that mode.</li></ul><h3>Maps</h3><p>Unlike other open-world games, Red Faction: Guerrilla uses special designed maps for its multiplayer component.</p><table><tbody><tr><th>Map Name</th><th>Anarchy</th><td><b>Capture The Flag</b></td><td><b>Damage Control</b></td><td><b>Demolition</b></td><td><b>Team Anarchy</b></td><td><b>Siege</b></td></tr><tr><td>Crash Site</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td></tr><tr><td>Deadzone</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td></tr><tr><td>Downfall</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td></tr><tr><td>Excavation</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td></tr><tr><td>Fall Factor</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td></tr><tr><td>Garrison</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td></tr><tr><td>Pinnacle</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td></tr><tr><td>Quarantine</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td></tr><tr><td>Radical</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td></tr><tr><td>Rift</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td></tr><tr><td>Sand Pit</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td></tr><tr><td>Settlement</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td></tr><tr><td>Warlords</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td></tr><tr><td>Wastelands</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td></tr><tr><td>Wreckage</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td></tr><tr><td>Cornered</td><td>X</td></tr><tr><td>Crescent</td><td>X</td></tr><tr><td>Crevice</td><td>X</td></tr><tr><td>Framework</td><td>X</td></tr><tr><td>Gauntlet</td><td>X</td></tr><tr><td>Overpass</td><td>X</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Backpacks</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1117273-504x_screen0805_075.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1117273\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.56349206349206\" data-width=\"504\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 504px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1117273-504x_screen0805_075.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1117273\"><img alt=\"Backpacks include the Firepower backpack.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/33529/1117273-504x_screen0805_075.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1117273-504x_screen0805_075.jpg 504w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/1117273-504x_screen0805_075.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/33529/1117273-504x_screen0805_075.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Backpacks include the Firepower backpack.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/33529/1117273-504x_screen0805_075.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1117273-504x_screen0805_075.jpg 504w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/1117273-504x_screen0805_075.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/33529/1117273-504x_screen0805_075.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Backpacks include the Firepower backpack.</figcaption></figure><p>The game also features a power-up system called backpacks that can either be picked up from dispensers throughout a map, or as part as the initial spawning load out.

Later in the game, the rocket launcher is attached to some more heavily armored vehicles.</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><h3>Peacekeeper</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/1378826-1370079_rfg_2010_01_26_01_16_09_79_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1378826\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.58510638297872\" data-width=\"564\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 564px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:58.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/1378826-1370079_rfg_2010_01_26_01_16_09_79_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1378826\"><img alt=\"Peacekeeper\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/1378826-1370079_rfg_2010_01_26_01_16_09_79_super.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1378826-1370079_rfg_2010_01_26_01_16_09_79_super.jpg 564w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7465/1378826-1370079_rfg_2010_01_26_01_16_09_79_super.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/1378826-1370079_rfg_2010_01_26_01_16_09_79_super.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Peacekeeper\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/1378826-1370079_rfg_2010_01_26_01_16_09_79_super.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1378826-1370079_rfg_2010_01_26_01_16_09_79_super.jpg 564w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7465/1378826-1370079_rfg_2010_01_26_01_16_09_79_super.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/1378826-1370079_rfg_2010_01_26_01_16_09_79_super.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Peacekeeper</figcaption></figure><ul><li>A close-range fully automatic shotgun, the Peacekeeper was traditionally used for crowd control by the EDF before adaptation to the warfare that ravages Mars in the game.

Only a few EDF weapons are introduced in Demons of the Badlands, particularly the Subverter (a submachine gun similar in form to the Pistol, but similar in power to the Assault Rifle). Additionally, the melee tool in Demons of the Badlands is known as the Ripper Pickaxe, and was originally used in the Ultor mines (a second Marauder weapon is known as the Impaler).</li><li>In contrast, a variety of Marauder weapons are introduced. Spike Mines are almost exactly the same as Remote Mines, save for differences in appearances. The Missile Pod is a version of the Rocket Launcher with a higher rate of fire, but slightly lowered damage. In the same vein as the Gauss Rifle, the Spiker is essentially a version of the Marauder Harpoon Turret found on many Marauder vehicles, but for portable usage.</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Downloadable Content</h2><p>Red Faction Guerrilla features three <a href=\"/downloadable-content/3015-329/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-329\">downloadable</a> expansion packs, each covering a separate game mode.

online RPG developed by ArenaNet, and continues the subscriptionless business model of the original Guild Wars. The game is set about 250 years after the events of its predecessor in a world devastated by the ancient elder dragons resurfacing after millennia of slumber.", "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Guild Wars 2 is the second game in the <a href=\"../../guild-wars/62-286/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Guild Wars</a> franchise. GW2 was developed by <a href=\"../../arenanet-inc/65-306/\" rel=\"nofollow\">ArenaNet</a> and still retains the original concept of having no monthly fees. The game uses a new engine with improved graphics over the original games, but can still run on moderate to high spec PCs. DirectX10 is supported but it is not required.</p><h3>Controls</h3><p>Guild Wars 2 has revamped controls compared to the previous game, eliminating \"click-to-move\" and adding a Z axis to allow for jumping and swimming. Characters can interact with the environment through motion significantly more, by <a href=\"../../jump/92-379/\" rel=\"nofollow\">jumping</a>, <a href=\"../../climbing/92-1864/\" rel=\"nofollow\">climbing</a>, <a href=\"../../swimming/92-2499/\" rel=\"nofollow\">swimming</a>, <a href=\"../../slope-sliding/92-3306/\" rel=\"nofollow\">sliding</a>, etc. Spells and abilities with cast times can be cast while moving, and it has been mentioned that using an ability while jumping or moving may cause it to perform differently than usual. Players can also <a href=\"/\">dodge</a> incoming attacks by key-binding a key or double tapping on any directional key.</p><h3>Skills</h3><p>Guild Wars 2 is unique in that it has a ten slot skill bar, of which only five skills are determined by the player. The rest are determined by the character\u2019s profession and weapon they currently have equipped. For example, a warrior with a two-handed greatsword will always have the same first five skills (the weapon\u2019s main damage dealing skills); with the latter five being drawn from a pool of healing, utility, and elite skills. These are customizable to best fit the player\u2019s play style and current situation and each profession and race will have a wide variety of utility skills from which to choose.</p><p>Weapon skills are unlocked through use of their associated weapon, while non-weapon skills can be collected using a mechanic similar to the one found in the original Guild Wars.</p><h3>Instancing</h3><p>Unlike the original game, which was completely <a href=\"/\">instanced</a> aside from towns and outposts, Guild Wars 2's world is entirely <a href=\"/\">persistent</a> except for dungeons and some personal storyline quests. Instead of each area having a series of \"districts\" so that not too many people are on one server, there are a list of \"worlds,\" similar to most MMOs' server or \"realm\" setups. There will be a 'Guesting' feature that will be released at a later date that will allow the player to play on another server with a friend without having to pay transfer costs. So far, guesting allows the player to perform the same tasks on the new server than they would on their own world, with the exception of participating in World vs. World. Persistent areas will have new \"dynamic events,\" essentially <a href=\"/public-quests/3015-1667/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1667\">public quests</a> that aren't always present but can be triggered as a result of the success or failure of other dynamic events in the area.</p><h3>Character Creation</h3><p>The character creation in Guild Wars 2 is much like other MMOs, where you select your race and profession and customize your appearance. After you select those, the game will ask you some personal questions about your upbringing to help flesh out your character. These choices have an impact on some aspects of your character's personal story. This feature is unique to each race and affects the development of your character's personal story drastically. The character customization has been drastically improved from the very limited customization in <a href=\"../../guild-wars/61-17494/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Guild Wars</a>. You are able to refine your characters body and face allowing you to modify your facial features and body type. Armor is also not exclusive to just a single profession, but are instead divided into weight classes - warriors and guardians (soldiers) wear heavy armor; thieves, rangers, and engineers (adventurers) wear medium armor; and elementalists, necromancers, and mesmers (scholars) wear light armor.</p><h3>Subscription Fee</h3><p>Like the original Guild Wars, there is no <a href=\"../../pay-to-play/92-1364/\" rel=\"nofollow\">subscription fee</a> to play Guild Wars 2. All that is required is a game purchase and an internet connection in order to play. The game has a microtransaction store, which is limited to cosmetic items or account services and not things that significantly impact gameplay.</p><h2>Character Races</h2><p>One of the most obvious new options for character creation is the addition of new non-human playable races. Each has some unique racial skills, such as the norn ability to shapeshift into various animal forms, or the asuran ability to summon different types of mechanized golems.</p><h3>Human</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4689/2437582-guildwars2-13-1920x1080.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2437582\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4689/2437582-guildwars2-13-1920x1080.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2437582\"><img alt=\"Logan Thackeray, human of Divinity's Reach\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4689/2437582-guildwars2-13-1920x1080.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4689/2437582-guildwars2-13-1920x1080.jpg 1920w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/4689/2437582-guildwars2-13-1920x1080.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4689/2437582-guildwars2-13-1920x1080.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>Logan Thackeray, human of Divinity's Reach</figcaption></figure><p>The only playable race in the original Guild Wars, the <a href=\"../../human/92-810/\" rel=\"nofollow\">humans</a> were the most prominent Tyrian race. The human kingdoms have suffered since the first game, however. After the rise of the dead continent of Orr from the bottom of the sea, vast numbers of the humans in <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/tyria/3035-283/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-283\">Tyria</a> died battling the dragon Zhaitan's <a href=\"../../undead/92-1155/\" rel=\"nofollow\">undead</a> armies. Orr's rise flooded the Krytan capital of Lion's Arch completely. Centuries ago, King Adelbern of Ascalon invoked the Foefire to prevent his kingdom from falling to the invading charr. He saved his kingdom at a terrible price: every living person within a vast radius was incinerated, then raised as a ghost. They must haunt Ascalon City eternally, defending their king even in death. The beleaguered remnants of Ascalonian humans live in Ebonhawke, their last stronghold. In the kingdom of Kryta, Queen Jennah rules benevolently from behind the walls of Divinity's Reach. Since the defeat of Abbadon in the first Guild Wars and the rise of the dragons in the intervening centuries, the Six Gods have withdrawn from interfering with daily human affairs. The gods are still widely worshipped by the humans and they do not feel abandoned by them, but rather tested.</p><h3>Asura</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4689/2437583-1111692-g9.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2437583\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4689/2437583-1111692-g9.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2437583\"><img alt=\"Zojja, asura of Rata Sum\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4689/2437583-1111692-g9.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4689/2437583-1111692-g9.jpg 1920w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/4689/2437583-1111692-g9.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4689/2437583-1111692-g9.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>Zojja, asura of Rata Sum</figcaption></figure><p>The <a href=\"../../asura/92-2400/\" rel=\"nofollow\">asura</a> are an incredibly intelligent race who lived beneath Tyria until they where forced out by the Destroyers during the events of <a href=\"../../guild-wars-eye-of-the-north/61-18110/\" rel=\"nofollow\">GW:EN</a>. Since then, they've built new lives for themselves on the surface. asura are short, usually have grayish hair and skin and are commonly arrogant and proud, considering the other races of Tyria to be inferior specimens. They created the asura gates, magical gateways that utilize portals for instantaneous long-distance travel, and they maintain strict control of these gates in the cities of all the other races. They have remained neutral with the other races, though they try to manipulate conflicts so they can gain power in the word of Tyria.</p><h3>Charr</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4689/2437584-gw2charr.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2437584\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4689/2437584-gw2charr.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2437584\"><img alt=\"Rytlock Brimstone, charr of the Black Citadel\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4689/2437584-gw2charr.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4689/2437584-gw2charr.jpg 1920w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/4689/2437584-gw2charr.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4689/2437584-gw2charr.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Rytlock Brimstone, charr of the Black Citadel\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4689/2437584-gw2charr.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4689/2437584-gw2charr.jpg 1920w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/4689/2437584-gw2charr.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4689/2437584-gw2charr.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Rytlock Brimstone, charr of the Black Citadel</figcaption></figure><p>The <a href=\"../../charr/92-2935/\" rel=\"nofollow\">charr</a> are a race of savage feline creatures that were responsible for the fall of the kingdom of Ascalon. The Flame Legion, comprised mostly of shamans, were the leaders of the legions during the Searing of Ascalon, having made a bargain with false gods known as titans to gain the power to invade the human kingdoms. After the titans were killed by humans, the Flame Legion was thrown into disarray. They discovered the destroyers and intended to make them their gods, but a group of charr led by Pyre Fierceshot felt the charr should no longer depend on false gods, and with the help of a group of humans he killed the shaman caste's leaders and the destroyers. Now the charr are in control of everything east of the Shiverpeaks except the mighty fortress of Ebonhawke and the haunted Ascalon City. The charr have four legions: The Blood Legion, the Iron Legion, the Ash Legion and the outcast Flame Legion (sometimes called the Gold Legion by other charr as a jeering reference to the metal's softness).</p><h3>Norn</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4689/2437585-1211157-guildwars2_07_1920x1080.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2437585\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4689/2437585-1211157-guildwars2_07_1920x1080.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2437585\"><img alt=\"Eir Stegalkin, norn of Hoelbrak\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4689/2437585-1211157-guildwars2_07_1920x1080.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4689/2437585-1211157-guildwars2_07_1920x1080.jpg 1920w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/4689/2437585-1211157-guildwars2_07_1920x1080.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4689/2437585-1211157-guildwars2_07_1920x1080.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Eir Stegalkin, norn of Hoelbrak\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4689/2437585-1211157-guildwars2_07_1920x1080.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4689/2437585-1211157-guildwars2_07_1920x1080.jpg 1920w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/4689/2437585-1211157-guildwars2_07_1920x1080.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4689/2437585-1211157-guildwars2_07_1920x1080.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Eir Stegalkin, norn of Hoelbrak</figcaption></figure><p>A race of nine-foot-tall heroes from the cold north, the <a href=\"../../norn/92-2399/\" rel=\"nofollow\">norn</a> worship the spirits of nature and have the ability to transform into their totem animal.

Norn are an individualistic race - they value a person's accomplishments over all else, and a norn's ultimate goal in life is to have their deeds immortalized, the stories of their accomplishments passed down to future generations. They have no concept of leaders or government, though some may choose to follow certain heroes who have accomplished legendary deeds.</p><h3>Sylvari</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4689/2437586-guildwars2-05-1920x1080.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2437586\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4689/2437586-guildwars2-05-1920x1080.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2437586\"><img alt=\"Caithe, sylvari of The Grove\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4689/2437586-guildwars2-05-1920x1080.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4689/2437586-guildwars2-05-1920x1080.jpg 1920w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/4689/2437586-guildwars2-05-1920x1080.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4689/2437586-guildwars2-05-1920x1080.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Caithe, sylvari of The Grove\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4689/2437586-guildwars2-05-1920x1080.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4689/2437586-guildwars2-05-1920x1080.jpg 1920w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/4689/2437586-guildwars2-05-1920x1080.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4689/2437586-guildwars2-05-1920x1080.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Caithe, sylvari of The Grove</figcaption></figure><p>The youngest race of Tyria, born less than 30 years before the start of the game, <a href=\"../../sylvari/92-3740/\" rel=\"nofollow\">sylvari</a> were created from a magical tree planted in Arbor Bay by the centaur Ventari. Before Ventari died, he inscribed a stone tablet with the values and lessons he'd learned throughout his life and laid it at the base of the tree. The tablet was found by the firstborn sylvari and became the foundation of their beliefs and morals. Before sylvari are born, they absorb knowledge of the world from the tree and from living memories of their race in a bond they call the Dream of Dreams. However, they often lack the experience to go with this knowledge, and are typically both curious and very naive as a result.</p><h2>Professions</h2><p>There are eight professions in Guild Wars 2, roughly categorized by the type of armor they wear: scholars wear light armor, adventurers wear medium armor, and soldiers wear heavy armor.</p><p>Unlike <a href=\"../../guild-wars/61-17494/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Guild Wars</a>, Guild Wars 2 does not have secondary professions. They found that the complexity of each individual profession was making the task of character creation overwhelmingly elaborate and extremely difficult to balance for the average user. Each profession has enough depth to stand on its own, so a secondary profession system was deemed unnecessary.</p><p>Guild Wars 2 also has no dedicated healing profession. Instead there is more focus on support roles, preventing damage before it happens with buffs or by controlling or blocking enemy movement so that enemies can't reach their targets.

The ranger is able to adapt to his/her opponent's many weaknesses with the variety of pets they have at their command, and their ability to strike a deadly blow from a distance. A ranger is always accompanied by their faithful pet. The ranger must bond with this pet and through that bond they gain a powerful connection to one another that makes them a force to be reckoned with on the battlefield. The ranger must charm a juvenile member of the species he/she hopes to attain. This enables the ranger to raise the animal and form a powerful bond with it as it ages. It is also worth noting that a ranger is a jack-of-all-trades and is adept at many things, and as such is able to use that to his/her advantage.</p><p><strong>Profession Mechanic: Pets</strong></p><p>Of course one of the most important aspects of the ranger's profession is the necessity of a pet, a loyal companion that will fight beside you to the death.

One of the most unique skills that the thief has access to is Steal.

Most are directed at a single target, but they are visible to anyone. They exist only as long as the target lives and can only be defeated by damaging the illusion directly. A mesmer may maintain up to three illusions simultaneously, with the newest illusion replacing the oldest. There are two types: clones and phantasms.</li></ul><p>1. Clone - A clone is an illusion that is physically identical to the caster, shares the caster's name, and has simple <a href=\"/artificial-intelligence/3015-218/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-218\">A.I.</a> behaviors. They tend to have little health and poor damage output. For example, a mesmer with a main-hand sword could use Illusionary Leap, which summons a clone that propels forward from their location. They would then have access to Swap, a skill that allows them to switch places with the clone they just created.</p><p>2. Phantasm - A phantasm is an illusion that resembles the caster but has its own name and illusionary weapons. Phantasms have less health than clones, but come equipped with a unique skill. For example, a mesmer might summon a Phantasmal Warlock that deals additional damage for every condition on its target.</p><ul><li>Mantra - A mantra is a skill with two phases. Their activation phase carries a relatively long casting time, but is followed by an instant-activation skill which can be used while casting other spells without interrupting them. For example, Mantra of Pain has a secondary phase that is an instant-cast spike, and is usable during any channeled skill.</li><li>Signet</li><li>Transform</li></ul><p><b>Weapons</b></p><table border=\"1\"><thead><tr><td><p><b>Main-hand</b></p></td><td><p><b>Off-hand</b></p></td><td><p><b>Two-handed</b></p></td><td><p><b>Aquatic</b></p></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>scepter</li><li>sword</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>focus</li><li>pistol</li><li>sword</li><li>torch</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>greatsword</li><li>staff</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>spear</li><li>trident</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Adventuring</h3><p>Teaming up and adventuring is very different in Guild Wars 2. Characters who enter an area with a designated level lower than theirs will have their \"effective level\" decreased to ensure all of the game's content remains relevant. The professions system has also been designed for both solo play and playing in an adventuring party. The game is very solo-friendly, with most of the content being soloable and difficulty scaling to the number of active participants. However, there is still a strong emphasis on teamwork and some dynamic events will require cooperating with larger groups of players.</p><h3>Dungeons</h3><p>Dungeons in Guild Wars 2 are not beginner content and the earliest will require characters that have reached level 30. They have two distinct modes that serve different purposes in terms of player progression and gameplay. The story mode of each dungeon exists as part of a greater narrative involving the story behind Destiny's Edge (the adventuring group that splits after the events of the Guild Wars 2 novel <i>The Edge of Destiny</i>) and the player's attempt to reunite the group once more to combat the Elder Dragons. Story mode is easy enough for a casual group of players to complete without much difficulty and can be repeated if desired.</p><p>Explorer mode, unlocked after the player has cleared the story mode of a dungeon once, shows the consequences of your previous actions in the area and typically gives the player's party three choices as to how the situation will be approached. Each of these three routes can create an entirely different version of the dungeon, with alternate pathways, areas, and enemies to conquer. As explorer mode is some of the most punishing content in the game, it requires a significant amount of planning and group coordination to overcome.</p><p>Both modes demonstrate the dynamic event system though events that trigger based on location, player action, or chance. Also, while each dungeon contains a unique set of weapons and armor, it will be no more powerful than gear found elsewhere in the game, providing only unique skins for increased customization of appearance. Tokens are awarded to the player after completing a dungeon, and these can be exchanged for items from that dungeon's set.</p><table><thead><tr><th scope=\"col\">Dungeon Name</th><th scope=\"col\">Story Mode Level</th><th scope=\"col\">Explorable Mode Level</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Ascalonian Catacombs</td><td>30</td><td>35</td></tr><tr><td>Caudecus's Manor</td><td>40</td><td>45</td></tr><tr><td>Twilight Arbor</td><td>50</td><td>55</td></tr><tr><td>Sorrow's Embrace</td><td>60</td><td>65</td></tr><tr><td>Citadel of Flames</td><td>70</td><td>75</td></tr><tr><td>Honor of the Waves</td><td>76</td><td>80</td></tr><tr><td>Crucible of Eternity</td><td>78</td><td>80</td></tr><tr><td>The Ruined City of Arah</td><td>80</td><td>80</td></tr><tr><td>Fractals of the Mists</td><td>n/a</td><td>80</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Player vs. Player</h3><p>The much praised player versus player (<a href=\"../../pvp-player-vs-player/92-346/\" rel=\"nofollow\">PvP</a>) system in the original GW has also been revamped. There is still a structured PvP system, allowing you to play at maximum level with everything (including all skills) unlocked. There's also a World PvP system taking place in the Mists, the \"area between world shards\". This allows characters of all levels to play against each other in massive battles. It is considered a bridge between <a href=\"../../pve-player-vs-environment/92-349/\" rel=\"nofollow\">PvE</a> and PvP.</p><p>All servers are constantly engaged in WvW combat, so people won't feel left out if their world happens to not be battling. There are always 3 worlds paired up against each other at once for a specific amount of time, up to two weeks. There are 4 maps in WvW: 3 home maps for each world and then a huge central map. The goal of WvW is to capture fortresses, acquire resources, and cut enemy supply lines. This is all in order to gain points, and obviously the more points you gain the better. If your world does well you gain bonuses for everyone in the world regardless of whether they participated or not. This could be an XP bonus or increased item drop rate. These bonuses are all based on how many points you gain. There is a minimum and maximum you can reach. Along with all of this there are world rankings, so the performance of your world results in you competing against worlds of similar rank. Migrating between servers is restricted to decrease the amount of people changing servers just to gain awards.</p><h3>Weapons</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4689/2437593-charr02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2437593\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"960\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 960px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4689/2437593-charr02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2437593\"><img alt=\"A pair of charr wielding rifles, one of the Guild Wars franchise's new weapons.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4689/2437593-charr02.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4689/2437593-charr02.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4689/2437593-charr02.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"A pair of charr wielding rifles, one of the Guild Wars franchise's new weapons.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4689/2437593-charr02.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4689/2437593-charr02.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4689/2437593-charr02.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>A pair of charr wielding rifles, one of the Guild Wars franchise's new weapons.</figcaption></figure><p>Weapons are divided into four categories: one-handed, two-handed, offhand only, and underwater weapons.</p><ul><li><strong>One-handed:</strong> <a href=\"../../axe/93-437/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Axe</a>, <a href=\"../../dagger/93-1306/\" rel=\"nofollow\">dagger</a>, <a href=\"../../mace/93-724/\" rel=\"nofollow\">mace</a>, <a href=\"../../pistol/93-59/\" rel=\"nofollow\">pistol</a>, <a href=\"../../sceptre/93-2055/\" rel=\"nofollow\">scepter</a>, and <a href=\"../../sword/93-1/\" rel=\"nofollow\">sword</a><b>.</b></li><li><strong>Two-handed:</strong> <a href=\"../../greatsword/93-451/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Greatsword</a>, <a href=\"../../war-hammer/93-729/\" rel=\"nofollow\">hammer</a>, <a href=\"../../longbow/93-1425/\" rel=\"nofollow\">longbow</a>, <a href=\"../../rifle/93-545/\" rel=\"nofollow\">rifle</a>, <a href=\"../../short-bow/93-2233/\" rel=\"nofollow\">shortbow</a>, and <a href=\"../../magic-staff/93-535/\" rel=\"nofollow\">staff</a>.</li><li><strong>Off-hand only:</strong> Focus, <a href=\"../../shield/93-87/\" rel=\"nofollow\">shield</a>, <a href=\"../../torch/93-484/\" rel=\"nofollow\">torch</a>, and warhorn.</li><li><b>Aquatic:</b> Harpoon gun, spear, and trident.</li></ul><p>Some professions can <a href=\"../../dual-wielding/92-135/\" rel=\"nofollow\">dual wield</a> two one-handed weapons, while others cannot. No single profession can wield every weapon, but each has different choices. Additionally, the game includes a wide variety of environmental weapons, such as <a href=\"../../boulder/93-1468/\" rel=\"nofollow\">boulders</a>, wooden planks, trebuchets, and even broken wine bottles.</p><h3>Environments</h3><p>There are many different types of areas to explore, from <a href=\"../../jungle/95-744/\" rel=\"nofollow\">jungles</a> to <a href=\"../../desert/95-1179/\" rel=\"nofollow\">deserts</a>, as well as <a href=\"../../underwater/95-719/\" rel=\"nofollow\">underwater</a> areas. There is also a 2-hour day/night cycle (1:20 of day and 0:40 of night) implemented as well as dynamic weather to add more realism to the landscape.</p><h3>Underwater Gameplay</h3><p>Areas that are underwater contain their own dynamic events, their own friendly, neutral, and unfriendly creatures (aquatic and amphibious), and their own major landmarks. Several zones in the game contain a significant portion of underwater content.</p><p>Breathing underwater is automatic, as a default breathing apparatus is given to all players and is automatically applied as soon as you become submerged. While swimming on the water's surface, you have no skills to fight with and may be attacked from below. As soon as you tilt your camera to dive down, your underwater utility skills, underwater weapon, and breathing mask all activate.</p><p>Underwater combat reflects the three-dimensional environment in which it takes place. AoE attacks, for example, also affect foes on the z-axis, and there are skills that either sink or float enemies. Not only does each player receive underwater-only weapons with their own five-skill sets, but several utility skills that are unfeasible for underwater use instead have equivalents that the player may choose to place on their underwater skill bar. In addition, when you run out of health underwater, you enter a \"drowning\" state, which functions similarly to the on-land \"downed\" state. Just like the downed state, you can rally by either killing an enemy before your secondary health bar empties or having an ally revive you. Unlike the downed state, however, you still have some freedom of movement and thus may also swim to the surface, where your secondary health will stop draining and start to refill. If you manage to regain all of your health, you will rally.</p><h3>Dynamic Events</h3><p>Guild Wars 2 also has dynamic events instead of quests. These events are truly dynamic and do not necessarily reset after a certain time period but actually cascade across the entire region. GW2 strives to avoid quest text as much as possible and instead tries to show and involve the player in the world around him or her. Players can decide the outcome of events and the \"next thing to do\" or the chain will progress as the characters choose. Dynamic Events celebrate community play, as each event dynamically scales the difficulty to correspond with the number of players participating. This also eliminates some <a href=\"../../griefing/92-87/\" rel=\"nofollow\">griefing</a>, as every player (even those not in groups) are rewarded for their contribution to the event.</p><h3>Chatting</h3><p>The chat system in Guild Wars 1 was very limited in that - outside of guild and alliance chat - you could only talk to people in the same city and district you were located in. Though eventually it was added that if you were trading/selling items you could bring up a screen showing what others were selling in different districts in that specific town, it was still rather limiting when compared to other MMO's. Guild Wars 2 improves on this, as a messaging system, along with the possibility to create chat channels have been implemented, thus allowing people from other worlds to join your chat room.</p><h2>Skill System</h2><p>Skills, one of the major features from the original <a href=\"../../guild-wars/61-17494/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Guild Wars</a>, has also been revamped. There are fewer skills that can be used in more situations, such as when surrounded by enemies. But perhaps the biggest change in the <a href=\"../../character-creation/92-217/\" rel=\"nofollow\">character creation</a> system is the increased <a href=\"../../level-cap/92-3025/\" rel=\"nofollow\">level cap</a>, which has been increased to 80. The level curve, however, remains consistent for all levels, and not scale like in most MMORPG's. Players with large level differences are still be able to play together because of a strong sidekick system not unlike the one used in <a href=\"../../city-of-heroes/61-19796/\" rel=\"nofollow\">City of Heroes</a>.</p><h3>Ten-Slot Skill Bar</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4689/2437595-elementalist_meteorshower.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2437595\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4689/2437595-elementalist_meteorshower.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2437595\"><img alt=\"An elementalist casting Meteor Shower, a staff skill.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4689/2437595-elementalist_meteorshower.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4689/2437595-elementalist_meteorshower.jpg 1920w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/4689/2437595-elementalist_meteorshower.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4689/2437595-elementalist_meteorshower.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"An elementalist casting Meteor Shower, a staff skill.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4689/2437595-elementalist_meteorshower.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4689/2437595-elementalist_meteorshower.jpg 1920w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/4689/2437595-elementalist_meteorshower.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4689/2437595-elementalist_meteorshower.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>An elementalist casting Meteor Shower, a staff skill.</figcaption></figure><p>Similar to the eight-slot skill bar featured in the original Guild Wars, Guild Wars 2 has a new customizable ten-slot skill bar.

A one-handed weapon also has different skills based on the hand it is equipped to (either the main hand or the offhand).

These are unlocked using skill points, which are obtained from leveling up as well as from an assortment of challenges located around the game world.</p><table><thead><tr><th scope=\"col\">Slot 1</th><th scope=\"col\">Slot 2</th><th scope=\"col\">Slot 3</th><th scope=\"col\">Slot 4</th><th scope=\"col\">Slot 5</th><th scope=\"col\">Slot 6</th><th scope=\"col\">Slot 7</th><th scope=\"col\">Slot 8</th><th scope=\"col\">Slot 9</th><th scope=\"col\">Slot 10</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Main-hand 1</td><td>Main-hand 2</td><td>Main-hand 3</td><td>Off-hand 1</td><td>Off-hand 2</td><td>Healing</td><td>Utility 1</td><td>Utility 2</td><td>Utility 3</td><td>Elite</td></tr><tr><td>\"</td><td>\"</td><td>Dual wield (thieves only)</td><td>\"</td><td>\"</td><td>\"</td><td>\"</td><td>\"</td><td>\"</td><td>\"</td></tr><tr><td>Two-handed 1</td><td>Two-handed 2</td><td>Two-handed 3</td><td>Two-handed 4</td><td>Two-handed 5</td><td>\"</td><td>\"</td><td>\"</td><td>\"</td><td>\"</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Racial Skills</h3><p>The primary and secondary profession system from the original Guild Wars has been completely overhauled. Guild Wars 2 has removed secondary professions, instead, coupling a character's primary profession with new racial skills which are specific to that character's race. Examples include the charr ability to plant a Shrapnel Mine or the asuran ability to Summon Power Suit, which they can climb into and use to devastate their foes.</p><h3>Traits</h3><p>Specific to each profession in Guild Wars 2, traits are used to modify a character's skills and attributes. Each profession has unique trait lines, such as Power and Tactics for warriors, and additional trait lines based on a character's equipped weapons. Within these trait lines, traits can be assigned that will alter skills and attributes, making them more useful in battle. Examples include Power traits that increases damage dealt or Tactics traits that lowers the cool down when switching between weapon sets. Traits, like skill points, are gained as you level up. However, unlike skill points, there are not any challenges to gain addition trait points.</p><h3>Crafting</h3><p>There is now crafting in GW2 allowing the player to specialize in up to 8 specific disciplines:</p><ul><li><b>Weaponsmith</b>: Craft melee weapons, such as swords, axes and hammers.</li><li><b>Huntsman</b>: Craft ranged weapons like bows and pistols, as well as torches and warhorns.</li><li><b>Artifice<strong>r</strong></b>: Craft magical weapons such as staves and scepters.</li><li><b>Armorsmith</b>: Craft heavy armor.</li><li><b>Leatherworker</b>: Craft medium armor.</li><li><b>Tailor</b>: Craft light armor.</li><li><b>Jewelcrafter</b>: Craft jewelery such as rings and necklaces</li><li><b>Cook</b>: Make food that the player can eat to get temporary buffs.</li></ul><p>The player is only able to specialize in two disciplines at a time, but the player is allowed to switch their disciplines as they please by talking to a master craftsman NPC in all major cities. Also, if the player wants to switch back to a discipline they previously leveled up they will maintain that level and their recipes. Though as you increase in level with that discipline the player has to pay a higher fee to switch back.</p><p>In order to craft items you first need supplies and these supplies can be gathered in 4 different ways:</p><ul><li><b>Salvaging Kits</b><strong>:</strong> Just like in <a href=\"/guild-wars/3030-17494/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-17494\">GW1</a>, you are able to salvage items and retain certain crafting materials from the item.</li><li><b>Looting</b><strong>:</strong> You can gather certain materials, such as hides, from enemies.</li><li><b>Harvesting</b><strong>:</strong> Ore veins, plants, and trees can be harvested for materials.</li><li><strong>Trading Post:</strong> As in <a href=\"/guild-wars/3030-17494/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-17494\">GW1</a>, you can always choose to just buy your supplies too!</li></ul><p>A key difference in GW2 from such games as <a href=\"/world-of-warcraft/3030-19783/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19783\">WoW</a> is that nodes are not exclusive. This means that you don't need to race players to nodes of rare materials, instead if you see a rare material you don't need to worry about someone else swooping in and getting it before you. This makes the crafting field open to everyone as opposed to just crafters needing to purchase materials from people who run around gathering materials.</p><p>Once you have the materials you need to craft an item, you need to visit the proper crafting station, whether this is a woodworking table, an anvil, a forge or a tanning station. The player is then be presented with an interface which allows the player to add up to 4 materials to the interface, which then gives them the option to make certain items. Also, for added ease, if you have never crafted that item before the recipe will be saved so you know exactly what you need to craft that item again. Most recipes must be learned by the player, but there are also some recipes that can only drop from mobs or be learned from a trainer.</p><p>This discovery system allows players to distinguish themselves from others since you aren't given a static list that you can just follow. Also, just like your combat, you have a crafting level as well. You increase your crafting level in a discipline by making items. There is a 400-point cap in every discipline. Since there are lots of potential items you can craft in each, the player won't need to just make an item because it gives the most experience. This system ensures that the player creates the items that are needed or wanted, rather than following a rigid crafting route.</p><p>Crafting is something players should take interest in because crafting can create weapons that are just as good as weapons dropped by powerful monsters. Of course this will usually requires the player to be very high of a level in crafting.</p><h2>Combat</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4689/2437597-gw2-traits-001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2437597\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"960\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 960px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4689/2437597-gw2-traits-001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2437597\"><img alt=\"\"Teach me, old man!\"\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4689/2437597-gw2-traits-001.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4689/2437597-gw2-traits-001.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4689/2437597-gw2-traits-001.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\"Teach me, old man!\"</figcaption></figure><p>The combat system expands upon on the system that was first developed in <a href=\"../../guild-wars/61-17494/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Guild Wars</a>. Tactical placement of your hero is important in Guild Wars 2 as opposed to just attacking once you are in range of your enemy. For example, if you use a skill that hits all targets in a straight line, you'll want to line your targets up for maximum effect. A spell that affects a cone-shaped area may need to be aimed in such a way that the middle of the cone is between two targets in order to hit them both. Some character skills promote flanking and provide bonuses if you attack from the side or the rear. The range of attack also plays a role in the combat mechanics. Now if a character is meant to attack at medium range they are going to want to keep that distance in order to be most effective and prevent the enemy from getting too close. The natural environment around the player also has an impact on combat and players are able to use it to their advantage.</p><p>Skill combinations have also been implemented. These occur when a party works together to complement each other's skills. When an elementalist uses the static field ability, it create a circle of electrical energy damages and stuns anyone entering or exiting it. A warrior who uses his rifle to shoot through this circle will charge up his shots, dealing additional damage. This allows the game to reward the party of people who have thought out their plan of attack, as opposed to an unorganized group that just runs in blindly.</p><p>There have also been changes to the death system. Not only are the consequences of dying different from the first game, but there is also a \"down but not out\" stage before the player bites the dust entirely. In this state, the player has access to profession-specific abilities that allow him to continue fighting. These downed skills are typically less powerful than your normal skills. If you manage to kill an enemy while downed, you will rally and get right back up and into the action. Other players, regardless of profession or level, have the ability to revive you when you are downed or defeated (dead). You can also choose not to be revived or rally and instead resurrect at any previously discovered waypoint on the map without any debuffs, experience loss, or corpse-running. This milder death penalty, along with the \"downed but not out\" stage before death, compliments the fact that there is no dedicated healer profession.</p><h2>Orders</h2><p>Orders are Guild Wars 2\u2019s answers to factions. At some point during the player\u2019s personal story they can make a choice to ally with one of the 3 orders. After the choice is made a player gains access to order specific armor, weapons, gear, and even certain parts of the players high level personal story are influenced. It is not required to join an order to play the game and it is possible to switch orders if the player wishes to.</p><h3>Vigil</h3><p>These crusaders understand that the world is a dangerous place. They intend to be an army of light against the onslaught of darkness.</p><p>Founded by charr general Almorra Soulkeeper, the order of Vigil are a group of crusaders comprised of multiple races who believe the Elder Dragons can only be defeated by the races of Tyria uniting to face them.</p><p>Current Leader: Almorra Soulkeeper</p><p>View: While there is darkness in the world the Vigil will be the light that protects those that cannot.</p><p>Method: The Vigil prefers to face the Elder Dragons head on, facing the minions of said dragons hoping to gauge their strength and find weaknesses to defeat them.</p><h3>Durmand Priory</h3><p>An order of scholars founded to secure and vanguard the lore and history of Tyria. Their most current and notable contribution is creating the language of New Krytan. They scour for lore on dragons of the past.</p><p>Current Leader: Gixx</p><p>Views: They believe knowledge is the greatest tool of sentient races and share it with the other races freely (but causally) so that it might better the races of Tyria</p><p>Method: They believe that the knowledge of the past encounters with the dragons will be the way to defeat them once and for all and hope to find lore on a way to stop them.</p><h3>Order of Whispers</h3><p>An Ancient order that originated from Elonia that relies of secrets and shadows, the order prefers running things behind the scenes so that others may claim the glory instead. It is rumored that they played a big part in slaying Abaddon and preventing him from bringing Nightfall upon the world. With their extensive networks stretching from Elonia to far beyond Tyria, they are not an order to be taken lightly. They are one of the few groups to have had knowledge of the Elder Dragons before they had awakened and returned to Tyria</p><p>Current leader: ???</p><p>View: You are truly victorious when your enemy knows nothing of you and you know everything of him.</p><p>Method: They believe there is no way to physically defeat the dragons and thus the only solution is to send them back to sleep.</p><h2>Guilds</h2><p>There are significant improvements involving guilds and there is also a lot more focus on the social aspects of guilds. <a href=\"/arenanet-inc/3010-306/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-306\">ArenaNet</a> has made Guild Wars 2 a very social experience and guilds will be a primary way to do this.</p><ul><li>Guilds are available to the player from the very beginning of the game and they are not race-restrictive. There is a small fee of 1 silver required to create a new guild, and additional fees for periodic capacity upgrades. The maximum guild size is 500 player accounts.</li><li>Each player is not restricted to one guild like in <a href=\"/guild-wars/3030-17494/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-17494\">GW1</a>. Instead, each character can represent any of the guilds associated with the account they reside on. An account can join as many as four guilds concurrently, though they can only represent one guild at a time, so the player would need to change their representation in order to gain influence points for a different guild.</li><li>A player can add to their guild's influence by participating in events, structured PvP, dungeons, and by just logging on once per day. The rate of influence accrued increases with the number of guild members in the same party.</li><li>Guilds with the most players contributing to a keep's capture in <a href=\"/world-vs-world-vs-world-combat/3015-6947/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6947\">WvW</a> may choose to claim that keep, which will prominently display the guild's emblem and provide purchasable buffs to allies near the structure.</li><li>The guild interface can display the representation status, rank, account/character name, current location, current world, profession, character level, crafting levels, and achievement points of members on the roster.</li><li>Influence can be used to purchase upgrades such as a vault for sharing items between guild mates and bonuses to things like XP and karma gain.</li></ul><h2>The Living World</h2><p>In January 2013 ArenaNet announced the \"Living world\" concept, where the game would be updated frequently with new events, areas and encounters for the player to explore with both temporary and permanent content. The idea was to motivate the players to log-on more often and always have some thing new to do that would take the story in the Guild Wars universe further than the main campaign. As of now new content will be released every second Tuesday.</p><h2>Marketplace</h2><p>The Black Lion Trading Post is Guild Wars 2's trading system. It is global and enables trade between different servers. Items may only be put up for sale while in-game, however it is possible to browse, bid, and cancel auctions and offers through a web browser. The seller does not have to be online for a transaction to complete, as the price paid will simply transfer to an account bank. The marketplace also displays the histories and trends of item values.</p><h2>Sound</h2><p>There is over 60 feature films' worth of dialogue recorded for the game, for everything from the concept art-driven cinematics, to NPC's alerting the player of a nearby dynamic event, to in-combat taunts/shouts to \"flavor\" conversations amongst NPC's.</p><p>Jeremy Soule composed the game's soundtrack, however players can select their own music and assign them to different audio cues (such as battle, ambient, etc.), letting the player tie their music to the appropriate engine-determined context. When necessary, the game may also revert temporarily to the default soundtrack for the best possible experience during dramatic moments (e.g. story development).</p><h2>Interaction with <em>Guild Wars 1</em></h2><p>As this game takes place 250 years after the original <a href=\"../../guild-wars/61-17494/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Guild Wars</a>, players are not able to transfer existing characters from the first game. Instead players can carry their name over from one of their characters from GW1. Also, players are able to gain titles and items through the Hall Of Monuments introduced with the <a href=\"../../guild-wars-eye-of-the-north/61-18110/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Eye of the North</a> expansion. Also, for those that took the time to reach the title \"God Walking Amongst Mere Mortals\" that title will be carried over for those players in GW2. There is a Hall of Monuments calculator released to help players maximize rewards from their hall, that can be seen <a href=\"http://hom.guildwars2.com/en/#page=welcome\" rel=\"nofollow\">here.</a> Items are gained up until the player reaches 30 Hall of Monument points, and titles are earned every 5 points until the maximum of 50 points. Instead of pieces of weapons or armor, a GW2 character may claim stat-less \"skins\" to apply to their existing weapons and armor. The Hall carries an indefinite supply of all available items.</p><p>Because Guild Wars 2 features different races and is set centuries after the first game, there is not an option for players to import their Guild Wars characters into Guild Wars 2.</p><h2>Release</h2><p>The game was released on August 28, 2012, with those who pre-purchased (already paid for the game in full) receiving the game three days early, and those who pre-ordered received one day.</p><p>As the game got nearer to its release, Beta Weekend events were scheduled for people who have pre-purchased the game, allowing them access to a slice of early content. The first of these events began on April 27th and, after some brief downtime hiccups, ended on April 29th. The third and final Beta Weekend Event was on July 20 - 22.</p><p>Guild Wars 2 shipped with three different editions all of which, if pre-purchased, included three special bonuses:</p><ul><li>Access to Guild Wars 2 Beta Weekends.</li><li>Early access to the final game three days prior to regular purchasers.</li><li>Hero's Band, an in-game item to boost the player's stats.</li></ul><h4>Digital Edition</h4><p>Digital Edition is the most basic version available with no special bonuses or extras, unless pre-purchased prior to the game's release.

The B button causes Batman to throw a basic punch or fire his equipped weapon, and the A button is used to jump. Tapping A performs a short hop, while holding the button down allows players to jump much higher. Batman can also use his <a href=\"/wall-jump/3015-5/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5\">wall jump</a> ability to reach even greater heights or bypass sections of certain stages; mastering this ability becomes critical in the game's later stages in order to progress. Pressing the Start button allows Batman to switch between his selected weapons, whereas the Select button pauses the game.</p><p>Batman begins the game with three <a href=\"/lives/3015-323/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-323\">lives</a> and eight units of <a href=\"/health/3015-130/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-130\">health</a> per life. Touching an enemy or its projectiles causes Batman to lose a single unit of health. When players deplete their entire stock of lives, they receive a <a href=\"/game-over/3015-372/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-372\">game over</a> and are prompted to either <a href=\"/continue/3015-635/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-635\">continue</a> from the beginning of the current sub-stage or end their game.</p><h4>Weapons</h4><ul><li><a href=\"/fist/3055-693/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-693\"><b>Fists</b></a>: Batman throws punches as his default method of attack, which can destroy most enemies in only a few hits. Unlike Batman's other selectable weapons, punching does not consume <a href=\"/ammo/3055-533/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-533\">ammunition</a>, but his melee range is severely limited.</li><li><a href=\"/batarang/3055-2043/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2043\"><b>Batarang</b></a>: A mid-range <a href=\"/boomerang/3055-76/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-76\">boomerang</a> weapon thrown straight ahead that quickly returns to Batman's location. It consumes one unit of ammo per throw and is capable of multiple strikes against a single enemy with proper use.</li><li><a href=\"/spear-gun/3055-3513/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-3513\"><b>Spear Gun</b></a>: This weapon consumes two units of ammo per shot. It fires projectiles straight ahead that can travel across the full length of the screen, making the Spear Gun well-suited for long-range attacks.</li><li><b>Dirk</b>: An unusual weapon that fires three disc-shaped projectiles that travel straight ahead across the screen. The Dirk consumes three units of ammo per shot and is useful against enemies that stay low to the ground, such as sliding <a href=\"/proximity-mines/3055-1309/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1309\">mines</a>.</li></ul><h4>Power-Ups</h4><ul><li><b>Bonus Item</b>: Adds 1,000 points to the player's <a href=\"/high-score/3015-260/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-260\">high score</a>.</li><li><b>Pellet Item</b>: Replenishes ten units of ammo, which is shared between all weapons.</li><li><b>Heart Item</b>: Restores one of Batman's eight <a href=\"/hit-points/3015-400/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-400\">hit points</a>.</li></ul><h3>Enemies</h3><ul><li><b>Shakedown and <a href=\"/maxie-zeus/3005-24154/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-24154\">Maxiezeus</a></b>: Standard <a href=\"/fodder-enemies/3015-7139/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7139\">fodder enemies</a> that run straight towards Batman and appear at least once per stage.</li><li><b>Mobile Tracker</b>: A small robot fitted with spikes that slowly patrols in certain areas. Its speed increases while Batman stands nearby on the same platform.</li><li><b>Heatwave</b>: Stationary henchmen that attack intermittently with <a href=\"/flamethrower/3055-45/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-45\">flamethrowers</a>. They're often encountered on narrow platforms or vertically-oriented passages.</li><li><b><a href=\"/deadshot/3005-20448/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-20448\">Deadshot</a></b>: Another stationary enemy that occasionally takes a single shot at Batman with his pistol.</li><li><b>Mobile Home Mine</b>: A mobile <a href=\"/proximity-mines/3055-1309/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1309\">proximity mine</a> that quickly slides across the ground when Batman gets close. It can be evaded by jumping; players can also destroy these mines from a distance with Dirks.</li><li><b>The Enforcer</b>: A <a href=\"/jet-pack/3055-6/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-6\">jetpack</a>-equipped enemy that guards the rooftops in Stage 1-2. He fires a machine gun at Batman while hovering around, but a few well-placed Batarangs can make short work of him.</li><li><b>K.G. Beast</b>: A unique <a href=\"/ninja/3015-12/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-12\">ninja</a> enemy that only appears once at the end of Stage 1-2. When first encountered, this enemy is reclining against a wall, giving Batman a chance to defeat the ninja quickly before he reacts.</li><li><b>Nightslayer</b>: Slow-moving henchmen equipped with massive claws on their arms that appear in Stages 2 and 4. By striking quickly, Batman can eliminate them at close range.</li><li><b>Javelin</b>: Introduced in the second stage, this stationary device repeatedly extends its long, spear-like arm toward players. While relatively easy to destroy, these can become a serious obstacle in jumping-focused areas.</li><li><b>Drop Claw</b>: Another stationary enemy mounted on ceilings. It regularly dispenses small mines that drop to the floor and track towards Batman.</li><li><b>Jader</b>: These large <a href=\"/mutants/3015-733/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-733\">mutant</a> enemies are biological weapons developed by Joker with impressive leaping abilities. Fast and difficult to dodge, they can also absorb significant damage from Batman's weapons.</li><li><b>EEV</b>: Encountered in Stages 3 and 5, these goon-controlled mini-<a href=\"/tank/3055-92/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-92\">tanks</a> fire large projectiles at players from long range.</li><li><b>Rail Runner</b>: Robotic enemies appearing briefly in Stage 4. Mounted on a horizontal rail, it travels left-to-right while trying to crash into Batman.</li></ul><h3>Stages</h3><p>The NES version of Batman: The Video Game consists of five total Stages, each of which is split into two or more sub-stages. Batman must defeat the <a href=\"/bosses/3015-229/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-229\">boss</a> at the end of each Stage to proceed.</p><p><strong>Stage 1: Gotham City</strong></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/33/236051-batman_screen.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-236051\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/33/236051-batman_screen.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-236051\"><img alt=\"Killer Moth\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/33/236051-batman_screen.gif\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/33/236051-batman_screen.gif 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"></a><figcaption>Killer Moth</figcaption></figure><p>After the game's opening cutscene featuring the <a href=\"/batmobile/3055-1231/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1231\">Batmobile</a>, Batman hits the mean streets of Gotham City, fighting the Joker's low-level goons as he passes through Gotham's deserted downtown district. The Stage's second area takes place among several high-rise buildings and introduces players to the concept of wall jumping. A crafty ninja called K.G. Beast waits for Batman near the end of this area to challenge the Caped Crusader before he can proceed to Stage 1's boss fight.</p><p>Batman encounters the first boss, <a href=\"/killer-moth/3005-6424/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-6424\">Killer Moth</a>, at the front steps of Gotham City Hall. This flying foe swoops around the screen and fires blue projectiles in a fan-shaped pattern. Following his defeat, another cutscene plays showing the Batmobile shooting its way through a metal shutter with mounted machine guns.</p><p><strong>Stage 2: Axis Chemical Factory</strong></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/33/236047-batman4.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-236047\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/33/236047-batman4.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-236047\"><img alt=\"High-voltage floors in Stage 2-2\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/33/236047-batman4.gif\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/33/236047-batman4.gif 256w\"><noscript><img alt=\"High-voltage floors in Stage 2-2\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/33/236047-batman4.gif\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/33/236047-batman4.gif 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"></noscript></a><figcaption>High-voltage floors in Stage 2-2</figcaption></figure><p>Batman enters the Joker's hideout at <a href=\"/ace-chemicals/3035-3719/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-3719\">Axis Chemicals</a>, the source of the <a href=\"/deadly-gas/3015-3541/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3541\">poison gas</a> that Joker plans to unleash during Gotham's bicentennial parade. According to the game's instruction manual, the factory's first section is filled with toxic green \"gluk,\" an <a href=\"/acid/3055-2062/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2062\">acidic</a> substance that quickly saps Batman's health upon contact. A series of small platforms above the hazardous slime serves as the means to cross safely, provided players can also dodge the gluk droplets falling from above. <a href=\"/electricity/3015-3624/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3624\">Electrified</a> walls and floors are positioned throughout the factory's second area, many of which require carefully-timed wall jumps in order to prevent a nasty shock. In the final area, Batman has to cross a series of several <a href=\"/conveyor-belt/3055-2396/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2396\">conveyor belts</a> while also avoiding Drop Claw mines and dangerous spinning gears.</p><p>At the end of Stage 2, Batman faces off with the \"Machine Intelligence System,\" a completely mechanical boss consisting of four separate <a href=\"/weak-spot/3015-296/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-296\">weak points</a> that must be destroyed in succession while dealing with additional conveyor belts. Once the machine's core is destroyed, a short cutscene depicting Joker firing his pistol at the screen is shown.</p><p><strong>Stage 3: Underground Conduit</strong></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/129563/2861799-electrocutioner.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2861799\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/129563/2861799-electrocutioner.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2861799\"><img alt=\"Electrocutioner\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/129563/2861799-electrocutioner.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/129563/2861799-electrocutioner.png 256w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Electrocutioner\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/129563/2861799-electrocutioner.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/129563/2861799-electrocutioner.png 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Electrocutioner</figcaption></figure><p>After shutting down Axis Chemicals, the Dark Knight drops into a series of <a href=\"/sewer/3035-348/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-348\">sewer</a> tunnels where he is ambushed by several dangerous Jader enemies. Much of the first section of this Stage is half-flooded and contains exposed spinning turbines that must be avoided. In the second area, the flowing water changes to a bright green color as it spills down into a large chamber. Batman must make his way to the bottom of this room, dealing with additional enemies and turbines before wall-jumping up a narrow passage leading to the third sub-stage, a reddish-colored cavern. The large cavern area contains a few armored EEV mini-tanks that can strike at players from long range. After dismantling the tanks, players must scale a very cramped vertical shaft filled with Heatwave enemies and wall-mounted shredders before finally reaching Stage 3's boss.</p><p><a href=\"/electrocutioner/3005-28039/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-28039\">Electrocutioner</a> is equipped with a massive claw capable of generating large crescent-shaped blasts of energy.

Unfortunately, this boss is also very agile and will leap up to strike while players stand on the upper platforms. Defeating the electrified terror leads to another short cutscene where the Joker invites Batman to view his \"latest work of art\".</p><p><strong>Stage 4: Laboratory Ruins</strong></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/129563/2861803-batman_-_nes_-_stage_4.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2861803\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/129563/2861803-batman_-_nes_-_stage_4.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2861803\"><img alt=\"Jader attacks in Stage 4-1\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/129563/2861803-batman_-_nes_-_stage_4.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/129563/2861803-batman_-_nes_-_stage_4.png 256w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Jader attacks in Stage 4-1\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/129563/2861803-batman_-_nes_-_stage_4.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/129563/2861803-batman_-_nes_-_stage_4.png 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Jader attacks in Stage 4-1</figcaption></figure><p>In the Research Laboratory (4-1), Batman starts out in a futuristic backdrop where flashing conduits are seen against the metallic floors. While traversing the lab, Batman is attacked by several mechanical enemies and the mutant Jader creatures. In the foreground, there are strange cylinders filled with green liquid and three television screens with the Joker's laughing face broadcasting. The Storage Room (4-2) is marked by the Joker's trademark greens and purples. Batman starts out platform jumping over several grinding gears from below. Soon, the same gears are cranking from all sides.</p><p>Once Batman enters the Thermal Processing Plant (4-3), Batman starts out across from the Exit door he must reach, but the jump is too far. In this area, he jumps down several floors evading the dangerous track bots and live circuits. There's also a large pool of flames that Batman must avoid at all cost. Part of the laboratory here is starting to deteriorate. Eventually, Batman comes to several tiny moving treads that he must use to platform and wall jump while evading Mobile Units and live circuits. Finally, he accends the stairs, fighting off several enemies to reach the Exit door.</p><p>The Dual-Container Alarm (4-4) are two large cubes that move opposite each other across the room's walls. Both of these containers fire projectiles at Batman to the left and to the right. These containers are very slow moving and can be evaded easily if Batman fights in the proper area. After the first container is destroyed, the remaining cube enters a state of emergency, opening from the top and erupting with several fire bombs. These six projectiles move across the screen and can be hard to avoid as the container skims across the bottom of the room.</p><p>After the boss is defeated, Batman hops into his Batwing and flies towards the Cathedral where the Joker has escaped to.</p><p><strong>Stage 5: Cathedral</strong></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/129563/2861804-the_joker.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2861804\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/129563/2861804-the_joker.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2861804\"><img alt=\"Final battle with the Joker\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/129563/2861804-the_joker.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/129563/2861804-the_joker.png 256w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Final battle with the Joker\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/129563/2861804-the_joker.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/129563/2861804-the_joker.png 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Final battle with the Joker</figcaption></figure><p>When Batman enters the Stairway (5-1), he's immediately faced with more grinding gears and more flamethrower goons. After scaling the stairway, Batman then begins to scale the Belltower itself. This involves an epic wall jump scenario wherein Batman must avoid several javelin bots, grinding gears, flamethrowers, Mobile Units and Drop Claws. Perhaps this was the implimentation of today's Vertical Combat concept?</p><p>Batman is thrust immediately into a boss fight (5-2) against Firebug. Working as Joker's bodyguard, Firebug wants revenge against the Batman for defeating his brother. This horned villain from the comic books conjures six-hundred million degree fireballs, tossing them at Batman while he jumps around the stage rapidly. Firebug is easy enough to defeat, but leads into the final battle with The Joker.</p><p>Joker: \"Greetings Batbrain - Are you ready to meet your destiny?\"</p><p>The final confrontation (5-3) pits Batman against The Joker himself. Wearing the trademark purple suit and green hair, The Joker fires powerful bullets from the massive, long pistol he uses in the film before, of course, summoning three lightning bolts. They have to make a boss fight against a mastermind like The Joker more interesting, right? After a tough, strategic battle, Batman knocks The Joker out. He tries to stand, but only manages to fall back down in defeat. Cue the next cutscene.</p><p>Batman: \"I know you murdered my parents. Now you will dance with the devil in the pale moonlight!\"</p><p>Then throws him off the very top of the belltower. We see The Joker fall from the belltower then a shot of his body alone, underneath a streetlamp before a close up on his smiling face fades to black.</p>", "expected_release_day": 22, "expected_release_month": 12, "expected_release_quarter": null, "expected_release_year": 1989, "guid": "3030-21264", "id": 21264, "image": {"icon_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/2361161-nes_batman.jpg", "medium_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_medium/2361161-nes_batman.jpg", "screen_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/screen_medium/2361161-nes_batman.jpg", "screen_large_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/screen_kubrick/2361161-nes_batman.jpg", "small_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_small/2361161-nes_batman.jpg", "super_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_large/2361161-nes_batman.jpg", "thumb_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_avatar/2361161-nes_batman.jpg", "tiny_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_mini/2361161-nes_batman.jpg", "original_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/2361161-nes_batman.jpg", "image_tags": "All Images,Box Art"}, "image_tags": [{"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-21264/?filter=image_tag%3AAll+Images", "name": "All Images", "total": 99}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-21264/?filter=image_tag%3ABox+Art", "name": "Box Art", "total": 7}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-21264/?filter=image_tag%3ACommercial+Ad", "name": "Commercial Ad", "total": 1}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-21264/?filter=image_tag%3AGB+Screenshots", "name": "GB Screenshots", "total": 2}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-21264/?filter=image_tag%3AGEN+Screenshots", "name": "GEN Screenshots", "total": 6}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-21264/?filter=image_tag%3ANES+Screenshots", "name": "NES Screenshots", "total": 75}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-21264/?filter=image_tag%3AScreenshots", "name": "Screenshots", "total": 85}], "name": "Batman: The Video Game", "number_of_user_reviews": 0, "original_game_rating": null, "original_release_date": null, "platforms": [{"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-3/", "id": 3, "name": "Game Boy", "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/game-boy/3045-3/", "abbreviation": "GB"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-6/", "id": 6, "name": "Genesis", "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/genesis/3045-6/", "abbreviation": "GEN"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-14/", "id": 14, "name": "Commodore 64", "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/commodore-64/3045-14/", "abbreviation": "C64"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-21/", "id": 21, "name": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/nintendo-entertainment-system/3045-21/", "abbreviation": "NES"}], "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/batman-the-video-game/3030-21264/"}, {"aliases": null, "api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-21268/", "date_added": "2008-07-23 06:31:26", "date_last_updated": "2019-06-23 20:33:41", "deck": "The Hobbit is a 3D action-adventure platformer based on J.

During the party's travels, Bilbo will find himself battling <a href=\"/orc/3015-492/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-492\"> orcs</a>, <a href=\"/goblins/3015-1593/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1593\"> goblins</a>, <a href=\"/wolf/3015-2265/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2265\"> wolves</a>, and <a href=\"/spider/3015-1873/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1873\"> spiders</a>, as well as sneaking past <a href=\"/trolls/3015-1446/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1446\"> trolls</a> and collecting a lot of <a href=\"/side-quests/3015-338/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-338\">side-quest</a> items.</p><p>As a character, Bilbo does not have an incredible amount of abilities. He can throw stones to knock down items and ward off foes, strike enemies with his walking stick and later the sword Sting, climb ropes and ladders, pick locks via a selection of <a href=\"/minigames/3015-116/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-116\"> mini-games</a>, <a href=\"/stealth/3015-24/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-24\"> sneak</a> to avoid detection, and use the <a href=\"/one-ring/3055-269/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-269\"> One Ring</a> to turn invisible. Bilbo can also collect silver pennies which can be used to purchase helpful items from a vendor at the end of each level. There's a small RPG element in The Hobbit; Bilbo gains Courage Points experience for defeating monsters and completing side-quests, increasing his health. <a href=\"/scroll/3055-1083/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1083\"> Scrolls</a> teach Bilbo abilities which he can use for battle and other situations throughout the game. </p><h3>Chapter Levels</h3><ul><li><a href=\"/dreamworld/3015-200/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-200\"> <strong>Dreamworld</strong></a>: Bilbo passes out when the thirteen dwarves visit and Gandalf informs him of his part in their plot.

You start out, like the first game, as a <a href=\"/pokemon/3015-549/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-549\">pok\u00e9mon</a> without a name (which you pick at that point) and a memory. Whatever partner pok\u00e9mon you then choose will find you and will. He will tell you who he is and what his dream is (becoming an explorer). You then go to the guild and get let in to apply as apprentices to the guild. You will then take on several mission making a small sub-story that will cross with the main story. After a while you will find out that a pok\u00e9mon named <a href=\"/grovyle/3015-4994/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4994\">Grovyle</a>. As the game progresses you try and stop Grovyle from taking all of the time gears which, once taken, freeze time in that area. You will cross paths with bosses like <a href=\"/groudon/3015-1633/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1633\">Groudon</a>, Mespirit, <a href=\"/uxie/3015-6783/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6783\">Uxie</a>, and <a href=\"/azelf/3015-6791/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6791\">Azelf</a>. You will also gain an ally pok\u00e9mon who says he has been chasing after Grovyle. Once Grovyle tries to take Azelf's time gear you, your partner and <a href=\"/dusknoir/3015-5622/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5622\">Dusknoir</a> (the new ally) battle and capture him. Once the battle is over you are taken back to the town where their is a cut scene. During this Dusknoir reveals that he and Grovyle are from the future then right as Dusknoir is about to take Grovyle through a portal to the future Dusknoir attacks and drags you along with him. Now you find out from Grovyle as you are being tortured that you were once his human partner and something happened as you tried to travel back in time that turned you into a pok\u00e9mon. So you guys eventually escape and you break out of the future with the help of <a href=\"/celebi/3015-1817/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1817\">Celebi</a>. When you return, even though you are reluctant you take Grovyle to the guild where he is accepted as a friend. Afterwards you try to discover how the now collapsing Temporal Tower, home of the controller of time: <a href=\"/dialga/3015-4086/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4086\">Dialga</a>. <a href=\"/wigglytuff/3015-1289/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1289\">Wigglytuff</a>, the guild master take you to <a href=\"/lapras/3015-2002/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2002\">Lapras</a>, one of his great friends. With the help of a relic, that your partner had found and cherished since before you arrived, you are guided to Temporal Tower where you will battle the somewhat brainwashed Dialga to save the world from the distortion of time forever. During this Dusknoir attacks and tries to send you back to the future, but Grovyle sacrifices himself and send himself and Dusknoir into the future. Once you beat Dialga you go through a cut screen. This time like the first game you will start to disappear and your partner will be sad especially since you knew you would most likely disappear. However you come back and Wigglytuff makes you and your partner an exploration team. You will then have to do random quest for a while including one that includes the manaphy egg(which will hatch into a Manaphy after awhile and then will leave) until one of the pok\u00e9mon <a href=\"/azumarill/3015-1942/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1942\">Azumarill</a> falls into an almost never ending nightmare. So you set out to find one of your old opponents (by the way this character had kidnapped the Azumarill), <a href=\"/drowzee/3015-1980/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1980\">Drowzee</a>, Once you have found him he will gladly help and send you into the nightmare with his powers. Once in the Nightmare you run into <a href=\"/cresselia/3015-4975/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4975\">Cresselia</a> who will say he is one of the guardians of space and says all of the planet will be covered in darkness unless you disappear. Luckily Drowzee is able to pull you out of the nightmare. That night you contemplate what Cresselia had said compared to what she had told you in dreams you had. (Which happened a few quest before all of this began) and something didn't add up. When you fall asleep Cresselia enters your dreams and tries to attack you again but this time <a href=\"/palkia/3015-4085/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4085\">Palkia</a> the controller of all of space shows up to deal with you himself. He takes you to his domain where you fall to the near bottom floor and start to descend. Once you reach the bottom Palkia appears and you fight. After the fight Palkia cant believe you have beaten him. Cresselia then appears and Palkia ask him to take care of you. Before that happens another Cresselia appears (the real one) and attack the other one who turns out to be, Darkrai the person who has not only been causing the nightmare but also attempted to destroy Temporal Tower to gain control over the world. He then tells you where he is fleeing to a leaves. At the same time Palkia falls into a nightmare like Azumarill (who is has awakened from his nightmare because of you entering into his nightmare) and Cresselia ask you to help him defeat <a href=\"/darkrai/3015-2490/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2490\">Darkrai</a> even though it is a trap. So you go to Darkrai's layer and find out you got turned into a pok\u00e9mon because of an attack Darkrai had cast towards Grovyle that you shielded him from, knocking you around in the dimensional vortex that you where traveling through. During this time Darkrai has put you into a nightmare but you break free and attack Darkrai. After defeating him you and your partner will do a few more missions until <a href=\"/manaphy/3015-5862/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5862\">Manaphy</a> appears on the beach again and everyone is happy to see him. Which will set off a special quest to <a href=\"/phione/3015-5857/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5857\">Phione</a>.</p><h2><b>Gameplay</b></h2><p>A follow up to the 2005 duo of <a href=\"/pokemon-mystery-dungeon-bluered-rescue-team/3030-13974/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13974\">Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team</a>, the Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness aim to expand on the <a href=\"/roguelike/3015-1065/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1065\">rogue-like</a> gameplay of their predecessors. The games add the fourth generation of Pokemon found in the Diamond and Pearl games of the main series. As with the previous games, players control a human who has been turned into a Pokemon and a personality test at the start of the game determines which of the 16 possible species they will become.</p><p>The main focus of the gameplay is on gathering missions from the town noticeboard, which take place in randomly generated dungeons with the combat being more action orientated than in other Pokemon titles. If either the player or their partner runs out of health during the mission they are removed from the dungeon and must start again at the beginning, losing half of what they were able to gather.</p><p>Selection of Playable Pokemon:</p><ul><li><a href=\"/bulbasaur/3015-1071/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1071\">Bulbasaur</a></li><li><a href=\"/charmander/3015-1024/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1024\">Charmander</a></li><li><a href=\"/squirtle/3015-1037/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1037\">Squirtle</a></li><li><a href=\"/pikachu/3015-1269/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1269\">Pikachu</a></li><li><a href=\"/meowth/3015-1961/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1961\">Meowth</a></li><li><a href=\"/chikorita/3015-2101/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2101\">Chikorita</a></li><li><a href=\"/cyndaquil/3015-2103/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2103\">Cyndaquil</a></li><li><a href=\"/totodile/3015-1351/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1351\">Totodile</a></li><li><a href=\"/treecko/3015-3693/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3693\">Treecko</a></li><li><a href=\"/torchic/3015-3981/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3981\">Torchic</a></li><li><a href=\"/mudkip/3015-2300/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2300\">Mudkip</a></li><li><a href=\"/skitty/3015-5335/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5335\">Skitty</a></li><li><a href=\"/turtwig/3015-4190/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4190\">Turtwig</a></li><li><a href=\"/chimchar/3015-4191/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4191\">Chimchar</a></li><li><a href=\"/piplup/3015-4192/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4192\">Piplup</a></li><li><a href=\"/munchlax/3015-2760/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2760\">Munchlax</a></li></ul><h2>Guild</h2><p><ins>Guild Missions</ins></p><p>As a part of the guild you can choose missions to take on to advance in the main game or gain items.

Players control an unnamed Rebel soldier.</p><h4>Destroy the Shield Generator (Part 1)</h4><p>The mission begins with the player piloting a Military Speeder Bike, shooting down other Speeder Bikes (piloted by Scout Troopers) while avoiding tree branches and AT-ST Walker fire.</p><h4>Destroy the Shield Generator (Part 2)</h4><p>From here, players maneuver on-foot toward's the shield generator's entrance, shooting down <a href=\"/stormtrooper/3015-2030/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2030\">Stormtroopers</a> and other Imperial infantry with their blaster (which can overheat due to continuous fire).</p><p>Both <a href=\"/c-3po/3005-4030/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4030\">C-3PO</a> and <a href=\"/r2d2/3005-3518/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3518\">R2-D2</a> make an appearance and can be shot at to reduce the player's Force Level. <a href=\"/ewok/3015-3824/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3824\">Ewoks</a> can also appear as a \"special event\" to aid the player.</p><h4>Destroy the Shield Generator (Part 3)</h4><p>After the charges are planted, players then need to bring down an AT-ST Walker before it reaches the entrance.</p><p>The overall mission can be \"failed\" if players do not eliminate the AT-ST Walker in time.</p><h3>Boba Fett / Darth Vader (Special Stage)</h3><p>Players encounter two bonus <a href=\"/lightsaber/3055-70/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-70\">lightsaber</a> stages throughout the game, the first (Boba Fett) after completing two missions and the second (Darth Vader) after completing all three missions.

In addition, players must destroy walls so they do not collide with them.</p><h4>Destroy the Death Star's Main Reactor (Part 3)</h4><p>Taking place inside the hull of the Death Star, players must destroy the structures that block them from the main reactor.

Playing it requires players to patch an existing copy of the original game, which cannot run on an unmodified Saturn.</p><h2>Characters</h2><h4>New Additions</h4><ul><li><a href=\"/tetsuko-ogigaya/3005-35118/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-35118\">Tetsuko Ougigaya</a> (Asuka's mentor, sub-boss for Asuka and Karina, unlockable)</li><li><a href=\"/genichiro-shindo/3005-35119/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-35119\">Genichirou Shindou</a> (school director, hidden boss for Shinobu, unlockable)</li></ul><h4>Returning Fighters</h4><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/asuka-honda/3005-32003/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-32003\">Asuka Honda</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/tamaki-shindou/3005-35128/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-35128\">Tamaki Shindou</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/torami-honjou/3005-35127/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-35127\">Torami Honjou</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/ryuko-yamazaki/3005-35126/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-35126\">Ryuko Yamazaki</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/kumi-okubo/3005-35124/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-35124\">Kumi Okubo</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/megumi-suzuki/3005-35125/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-35125\">Megumi Suzuki</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/cathy-wild/3005-35122/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-35122\">Cathy Wild</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/karina-toyota/3005-35129/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-35129\">Karina Toyota</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/nana-owada/3005-35123/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-35123\">Nana Owada</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/kiyoko-miterai/3005-35121/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-35121\">Kiyoko Mitarai</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/shinobu-kawasaki/3005-35120/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-35120\">Shinobu Kawasaki</a> (hidden boss for most characters, unlocked from the start)</li></ul>", "expected_release_day": 9, "expected_release_month": 10, "expected_release_quarter": null, "expected_release_year": 1997, "guid": "3030-21763", "id": 21763, "image": {"icon_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/246148-574557_46126_front.jpg", "medium_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_medium/246148-574557_46126_front.jpg", "screen_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/screen_medium/246148-574557_46126_front.jpg", "screen_large_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/screen_kubrick/246148-574557_46126_front.jpg", "small_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_small/246148-574557_46126_front.jpg", "super_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_large/246148-574557_46126_front.jpg", "thumb_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_avatar/246148-574557_46126_front.jpg", "tiny_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_mini/246148-574557_46126_front.jpg", "original_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/246148-574557_46126_front.jpg", "image_tags": "All Images,Game Boxes"}, "image_tags": [{"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-21763/?filter=image_tag%3AAll+Images", "name": "All Images", "total": 4}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-21763/?filter=image_tag%3AAdvertisements", "name": "Advertisements", "total": 2}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-21763/?filter=image_tag%3ABox+Art", "name": "Box Art", "total": 2}], "name": "Asuka 120% Limited Burning Fest.", "number_of_user_reviews": 0, "original_game_rating": null, "original_release_date": null, "platforms": [{"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-42/", "id": 42, "name": "Saturn", "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/saturn/3045-42/", "abbreviation": "SAT"}], "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/asuka-120-limited-burning-fest/3030-21763/"}, {"aliases": null, "api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-21785/", "date_added": "2008-07-28 05:03:57", "date_last_updated": "2019-06-07 09:40:45", "deck": "In this 80s arcade game, players must help the five members of the rock band Journey rescue their stolen instruments from alien 'groupoids' so that they can put on a 'Super Space Concert'.", "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Journey centers around the fictional adventures of the 80s rock band Journey, as they travel through space to retrieve their stolen instruments from Wild Alien Groupoids.</p><p>From the game:</p><blockquote data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"small\"><p>\"Wild alien groupoids have seized Journey's electro-supercharged instruments. Your mission is to help Journey retrieve their instruments from the dangers of the five galaxies. Trek through hazardous obstacles in quest of each instrument and then battle your way back to the scarab vehicle. When all five missions are completed, Journey begins a spectacular concert at the galactic stadium. Journey plays their hit song while Herbie guards the stage from frenzied groupoids who are trying to take the instruments.\"</p></blockquote><p>Steve Perry, the ex-frontman/vocalist for Journey, has been quoted as saying that he thought the idea was \"dumb\", and that at the time, he was quite happy with the status the band had achieved, and didn't think they needed a video game.</p><p>This game was created at the peak of Journey's career, and it was thought they could ride the wave right into the arcade market. While not really that unique as a game, it did bring a couple of interesting ideas to the arcade environment. The first was the use of digitized images of the band within the game. Each band member was represented by a tiny little cartoon body, with a black and white digitized shot of their face for a head. There are a few different faces for each band member depending on the situation.</p><p>As well, the arcade cabinet contained a special looping tape of \"Separate Ways\", which would play during the final level, giving the impression that players were really hearing Journey play for a bunch of alien groupoids.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>The game opens with a shot of the band getting into their \"Scarab vehicle\".</p><p>Players are then prompted with the main \"level select\" screen of the game. Each of the band members has their own level where they must retrieve their instrument of choice. There is no necessary order of accomplishing them, but all five levels must be successfully completed in order to advance to the final concert level.</p><p>Each of the five band members' levels have two parts: the first part consists of a member of the band retrieving their instrument, the second part involves returning back to the band's scarab vehicle.</p><h3>Steve Smith - Drums</h3><h4>Part I<b> </b></h4><p>The screen is covered in several floating drums, all which start off red. As players bounce Steve off each one, they turn blue, and then disappear on the second bounce. In order to complete the first part, players must turn all the drums blue. Players can also avoid the last drum and make all the other drums disappear for extra points, prior to turning the last drum blue.</p><p>Once players have turned the last drum blue, they rocket up to the drum set, and part two begins.</p><h4>Part II<b> </b></h4><p>Steve sits behind his drums; pressing the button causes him to shoot downwards in order to destroy incoming projectiles. Players must get to the glowing line at the bottom in order to complete the level.</p><h3>Neal Schon - Guitar</h3><h4>Part I<b> </b></h4><p>Neal has a jetpack, and in a Lunar Lander-type fashion, he can thrust upwards or to either side. Players must guide him through the space cavern without touching the walls/floor/ceiling and retrieve his guitar.</p><h4>Part II<b> </b></h4><p>Now that he has his guitar back, he can shoot energy bullets. Players must return him to the flashing line at the top of the stage (still avoiding walls, and also now mini scarabs) in order to complete the level. Players can shoot the mini scarabs for extra points, or just go back up to the top.</p><h3>Steve Perry - Microphone</h3><h4>Part I<b> </b></h4><p>Steve starts at the top of the level, while his mic is at the bottom. In between are dozens of obstacles that resemble rotating clock hands. Players must time their movements to navigate to the bottom on the screen in order to retrieve their microphone.</p><h4>Part II<b> </b></h4><p>Players once again must return to the top of the stage, only now all the 'clock hands' are closed and scrolling across the level. Players can use their microphone to blast through them. Once players return to the top, the level is complete.</p><h3>Ross Valory - Bass Guitar</h3><h4>Part I<b> </b></h4><p>Ross starts at the bottom of the level, and there are a number of kaleidoscopic launchpads scattered around. Players must bounce from platform to platform to reach the bass guitar, which scrolls from side to side at the top of the level. The longer players remain on the platform, the higher Ross gets launched.</p><h4>Part II<b> </b></h4><p>Having retrieved his bass guitar, Ross must return to the bottom of the level, however, all of the launchpads have now become turrets that aim at the player.</p><h3>Jonathan Cain - Keyboard</h3><h4>Part I</h4><p>Players progress down the level while avoiding lasers in order to reach the keyboard.</p><h4>Part II<b> </b></h4><p>Jonathan's keyboard can now shoot projectiles, which he can use to destroy crisscrossing pink spheres that block the path back to the scarab vehicle.</p><h3>Galactic Stadium Concert</h3><p>Once players have successfully retrieved all five band members' instruments, they head off to the Galactic Stadium for the super space concert.</p><p>As a loop tape of \"Separate Ways\" actually plays inside the arcade cabinet, players control Herbie, a fictional large bouncer. Players can move from side to side in order to prevent the groupoids from getting into one of three doors along the bottom of the stage. Each groupoid that players block adds 250 points; the stage continues until the player fails. The groupoids then rush the stage, re-steal Journey's instruments, and the game restarts back from the beginning.</p>", "expected_release_day": 12, "expected_release_month": 5, "expected_release_quarter": null, "expected_release_year": 1983, "guid": "3030-21785", "id": 21785, "image": {"icon_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/241066-vjourney.png", "medium_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_medium/241066-vjourney.png", "screen_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/screen_medium/241066-vjourney.png", "screen_large_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/screen_kubrick/241066-vjourney.png", "small_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_small/241066-vjourney.png", "super_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_large/241066-vjourney.png", "thumb_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_avatar/241066-vjourney.png", "tiny_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_mini/241066-vjourney.png", "original_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/241066-vjourney.png", "image_tags": "All Images"}, "image_tags": [{"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-21785/?filter=image_tag%3AAll+Images", "name": "All Images", "total": 4}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-21785/?filter=image_tag%3AArcade", "name": "Arcade", "total": 4}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-21785/?filter=image_tag%3AScreenshots", "name": "Screenshots", "total": 4}], "name": "Journey", "number_of_user_reviews": 0, "original_game_rating": null, "original_release_date": null, "platforms": [{"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-84/", "id": 84, "name": "Arcade", "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/arcade/3045-84/", "abbreviation": "ARC"}], "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/journey/3030-21785/"}, {"aliases": "Hard Edge\r\nT.R.A.G.: Tactical Rescue Assault Group\r\nTRAG: Tactical Rescue Assault Group\r\nTRAG: Mission of Mercy", "api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-21843/", "date_added": "2008-07-28 15:17:55", "date_last_updated": "2019-06-22 16:04:31", "deck": "The year is 2042.

After a voice beckons him to jump, Ragnar finds himself in a long passageway, split in several directions. The same voice leads him through the tunnel until he arrives in a small cave with a single treasure chest surrounded by a small river of water. Inside are the Flying Shoes, a key item in Ragnar's quest for the miss ing children. Within the cavernous tunnels, he also meets up with Healie, one of the jellyfish-like Healer creatures. Healie wishes to join Ragnar's quest in hopes of one day becoming a human. Healie makes a valuable addition to Ragnar's solo-quest, as the Knight Captain himself knows no magic and relies solely on medicinal herbs to heal himself. Healie is the first of many combative NPCs within the story.</p><p>Upon using the flying shoes, Ragnar is sent immediately to the abductor's tower. While the two scale the tower, Ragnar learns from a dying soldier the plot to find and kill the \"Legendary Hero\" while he or she was still a child so that the \"Ruler of Evil\" may be resurrected. Thus the kidnappings. Upon the destruction of Saro's Shadow and his Giant Eyeball cohort, Ragnar rescues the captured children. After returning them to Izmit Village, Ragnar meets with the King of Castle Burland. He requests to begin a new quest, to find the \"Legendary Hero\" and thwart the plan to resurrect the \"Ruler of Evil\".

These include:</p><p><b>Wagon</b> - Allows the player to choose wich characters fight in battle. A series first, the wagon may also be found in V and VI.</p><p><b>Casino</b> - A building full of mini-games and monster battling, the Casino is a nice respite from a hard day's work of saving the world.</p><p><b>Small medals</b> - Finding these nets the player rewards if they know what to do with them.</p><p><b>Balloon -</b> Air travel done the right way.</p><p><b>Day/night system</b> - A full, 24 hour day/night system.</p><p>Some features have been seen in past games, while others are exclusive to the IV, V and VI Dragon Quests (commonly referred to as a trilogy).</p><h2>Reception</h2><p>In early 2009, the NPD revealed that Dragon Quest IV had sold 76k since its release 4 months prior, suggesting that it had failed to attract the casual crowd. Otherwise the game was well received, and holds a respectable <a href=\"http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/ds/dragonquest4chaptersofthechosen?q=dragon%20quest%20iv\" rel=\"nofollow\">80 Metascore</a> garnering generally positive reviews. Many sources deemed it \"a must own for any JRPG fan.\" Pros commonly cited were the beautiful dual-screen presentation and interesting narrative structure, though some felt the exposition of the game lacked variety and challenge.</p>", "expected_release_day": 11, "expected_release_month": 2, "expected_release_quarter": null, "expected_release_year": 1990, "guid": "3030-22703", "id": 22703, "image": {"icon_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/2883943-main.png", "medium_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_medium/2883943-main.png", "screen_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/screen_medium/2883943-main.png", "screen_large_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/screen_kubrick/2883943-main.png", "small_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_small/2883943-main.png", "super_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_large/2883943-main.png", "thumb_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_avatar/2883943-main.png", "tiny_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_mini/2883943-main.png", "original_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/2883943-main.png", "image_tags": "All Images,Box Art"}, "image_tags": [{"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-22703/?filter=image_tag%3AAll+Images", "name": "All Images", "total": 63}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-22703/?filter=image_tag%3ABox+Art", "name": "Box Art", "total": 12}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-22703/?filter=image_tag%3AConcept+Art", "name": "Concept Art", "total": 1}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-22703/?filter=image_tag%3ADS+Screenshots", "name": "DS Screenshots", "total": 16}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-22703/?filter=image_tag%3AFan+Art", "name": "Fan Art", "total": 1}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-22703/?filter=image_tag%3ANES+Screenshots", "name": "NES Screenshots", "total": 15}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-22703/?filter=image_tag%3APAX+East+2011", "name": "PAX East 2011", "total": 1}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-22703/?filter=image_tag%3AScreenshots", "name": "Screenshots", "total": 33}], "name": "Dragon Quest IV: Chapters of the Chosen", "number_of_user_reviews": 0, "original_game_rating": [{"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-36/", "id": 36, "name": "PEGI: 12+"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-25/", "id": 25, "name": "CERO: A"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-29/", "id": 29, "name": "ESRB: E10+"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-38/", "id": 38, "name": "OFLC: PG"}], "original_release_date": null, "platforms": [{"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-21/", "id": 21, "name": "Nintendo Entertainment System", "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/nintendo-entertainment-system/3045-21/", "abbreviation": "NES"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-22/", "id": 22, "name": "PlayStation", "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/playstation/3045-22/", "abbreviation": "PS1"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-52/", "id": 52, "name": "Nintendo DS", "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/nintendo-ds/3045-52/", "abbreviation": "DS"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-72/", "id": 72, "name": "iPod", "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/ipod/3045-72/", "abbreviation": "IPOD"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-96/", "id": 96, "name": "iPhone", "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/iphone/3045-96/", "abbreviation": "IPHN"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-121/", "id": 121, "name": "iPad", "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/ipad/3045-121/", "abbreviation": "IPAD"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-123/", "id": 123, "name": "Android", "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/android/3045-123/", "abbreviation": "ANDR"}], "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/dragon-quest-iv-chapters-of-the-chosen/3030-22703/"}, {"aliases": "Yu Yu Hakusho Final", "api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-22736/", "date_added": "2008-08-01 02:21:40", "date_last_updated": "2019-06-30 10:37:13", "deck": "The game is based on the Saga of the Three Kings, though some characters from the Chapter Black Saga and from the movie appear.", "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>YuYu Hakusho Final: Makai Saikyou Retsuden (\"Ghost Files Final: Strongest Demon Biographies\") is a fighting game for the Super Famicom and the fourth and final <a href=\"/yuyu-hakusho/3025-873/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-873\">YuYu Hakusho</a> game to be released for the system.

The combat in the game plays out similar to Dragon Quest. The combat is represented via text with sprites on the screen representing the enemies.

The two main characters in the game are Ken, an army soldier tasked with the job of catching monsters; and his girlfriend Linda, who is used by the military as a surrogate for the god's plans. The inhabitants of the Neo Kenya called upon a god by the name of Anubis (a reference to the Egyptian lord of the underworld) in order to protect them from imminent destruction. Apparently answering their calls, the dark god sent an Ark similar to Noah's Ark. He demands that a man and a woman gather two of every animal on the planet.

It was nominated for two awards and won the award for \"Excellence in Visual Art\". Following the awards, <a href=\"/phil-fish/3040-100988/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-100988\">Phil Fish</a>, the mastermind behind Fez created \"Polytron Corporation\" as a banner under which he would develop and release the game.</p><h2>Development</h2><p>In <i>Indie Game: The Movie</i>, Fish talked about his five year struggle with trying to maintain Polytron Corporation by himself after his lead sound designer Jason DeGroot left. When showing the game at PAX Prime 2011, Fish risked a lawsuit with his former business partner due to unsettled royalty disputes. During development, Fez was completely remade three times due to lack of funding. The game was given an (ironic) release date of Friday the 13th of 2012. At the <i>Indie Game: The Movie</i> premiere, Fish stated that he currently has no plans to bring Fez to any other platform, but will consider doing so if the game sells well.</p><p> </p><p>A PC version of Fez was released on May 1, 2013 (<a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/224760/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Steam page</a>). Like the XBLA version, it's listed as being developed by Polytron and published by Trapdoor.</p><p>At Gamescom 2013, it was announced that Fez will come to PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation Vita.</p><h2>Plot</h2><p><a href=\"/gomez/3005-9607/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-9607\">Gomez</a> receives a letter, from a mysterious man with an <a href=\"/eyepatch/3055-94/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-94\">eyepatch</a>, telling him to meet him at the top of his town, when he arrives a mysterious object appears in the sky; a cube. Gomez suddenly gains the ability to rotate the 2D world in which he lives, and must collect cubes and their counterpart, anti-cubes.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10652/1617998-fez_p.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1617998\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56210526315789\" data-width=\"475\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 475px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10652/1617998-fez_p.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1617998\"><img alt=\"Gomez's room in 2D.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10652/1617998-fez_p.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10652/1617998-fez_p.jpg 475w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 475px) 100vw, 475px\" data-width=\"475\"></a><figcaption>Gomez's room in 2D.</figcaption></figure><p>As a puzzle-platformer, Fez gameplay is primarily map traversal, discovery, and item collection. Gomez can innately walk, jump, climb, ledge grab, drop through ledges, push, pick up, and throw items. During the opening sequence he gains the ability to rotate the perceived 2D world in 90 degree increments, around the vertical (Y) axis of the screen. This reveals that the environment is fully 3D in nature. Despite the ability to traverse multiple planes, Gomez can only move and interact with the 2D plane relative to the player, and will always migrate to the foreground layer when possible. For example, he cannot enter a doorway from the side, or when a background passage is obscured by a foreground object \u2013 even if Gomez is standing between them. He appears shadowed when in the background layer, and a silhouette when completely obscured behind the environment. (The music also becomes muffled.)</p><p>Gomez has no health meter, and upon death (by fall or otherwise) he will immediately respawn on the last stable platform he stood on. He also retains momentum relative to the world while it is rotated: jumping to the right and then rotating 180 degrees will continue the momentum to the left, but rotating 90 degrees will stop all forward motion.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13158/839153-gb.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-839153\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"1024\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13158/839153-gb.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-839153\"><img alt=\"Gomez can rotate the world to reveal new perspectives.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/13158/839153-gb.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13158/839153-gb.png 1024w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/13158/839153-gb.png 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/13158/839153-gb.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>Gomez can rotate the world to reveal new perspectives.</figcaption></figure><p>There are 64 cubes to collect in total - 32 Gold Cubes and 32 Blue Anti-Cubes. As well as being able to find cubes throughout the world, cube bits can be collected throughout the game and once 8 cube bits are found they create 1 cube. Anti-cubes are generally more difficult to obtain, requiring puzzle solving rather than standard platforming. Some puzzles involve deciphering glyphs and following their instructions. Others are rhythm puzzles, where the controller vibrates and a rotational direction correlates to the sound the controller makes while it vibrates.</p><p>Once the ending kill screen is reached, the player can then start a New Game + after the credits and gain the ability to view the world from a first person perspective. Certain puzzles require use of the first person view in order to complete them. New Game + also unlocks the ability to fly (to activate press up four times and then hold A). Once the game is completed a second time, a stereoscopic 3D option is unlocked.</p><h2>Environment</h2><p>The world of Fez consists of several areas which appear normal, but may contain physics-defying characteristics even beyond Gomez's abilities. For example, some maps scroll infinitely up and down in an endless loop. Others have an infinite cycle of passages or use doors to teleport to far away islands.</p><h3>World Map</h3><p>The world map is an intricate and complex 3D tree of branching locations. Every level and room in the game is a separate \"area\", represented as a hexagonal cell. When an area is explored, the map cell indicates what items and secrets remain to be discovered. When all secrets within a single area are discovered, the thumbnail and border of that map cell acquires a gold sheen.</p><h3>Warping</h3><p>There are several hub areas within Fez, and cubic warp gates link them together once discovered and activated. Smaller square warp gates transport Gomez back to the start of an area, and save the player an excessive amount of backtracking. Simpler, shortcut doors also open up specific routes between areas once the entrance is discovered and unlocked.</p><h3>Hazards</h3><ul><li><a href=\"/falling-damage/3015-2510/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2510\">Falling</a> \u2013 Gomez can fall approximately 8 blocks before the drop will automatically kill him, unless he lands in water. This measurement counts from his starting position, and does not take jump height into account.</li><li><a href=\"/crushing-trap/3015-3627/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3627\">Crushing</a> \u2013 Certain platforms move vertically, and if they collide while Gomez is between them he will respawn on the last stable platform.</li><li><a href=\"/black-hole/3055-915/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-915\">Black Holes</a> \u2013 Rips in space areas may appear in the environment. They suck Gomez in if he comes into contact with them.</li><li>Regenerating Blocks \u2013 <a href=\"/bomb/3055-97/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-97\">Bombs</a> are required to remove certain blocks, but if the entire chain is not destroyed they will regenerate and knock Gomez off the platform.</li><li>Totems \u2013 In certain areas, there may be powerful totems which prevent Gomez from freely rotating the screen. These totems must be interacted with and backtracked to, in order to access all sides of an area.</li><li>Water \u2013 Gomez is a buoyant swimmer and can jump out of water with no loss of height. <a href=\"/water-that-damages-the-player/3015-3841/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3841\">Hazardous water</a> will kill him instantly.</li></ul><h2>Items</h2><h3>Artifacts</h3><p>There are four artifacts hidden around the world in Fez. With the exception of the skull, these artifacts contain glyphs and are used to help decipher the language and numbers.</p><ul><li>Writing Cube</li><li>Counting Cube</li><li>Tome</li><li>Skull</li></ul><h2>Glyphs</h2><p>Fez contains a hidden language, numerical system, and code.

Two equals an open space on the right of the square. Three equals and open space at the bottom of the square. Four equals an open space the the left side of the square. Consulting the chart on the right, the number three can also be represent with an open space on the top and on the right; or, in other words, 1 + 2 = 3.</p><h3>Code</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/15/156864/2183323-FEZ_Inputs.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2183323\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.6\" data-width=\"500\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 500px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:60.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/15/156864/2183323-FEZ_Inputs.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2183323\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/15/156864/2183323-FEZ_Inputs.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/15/156864/2183323-FEZ_Inputs.jpg 500w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/15/156864/2183323-FEZ_Inputs.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/15/156864/2183323-FEZ_Inputs.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/15/156864/2183323-FEZ_Inputs.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/15/156864/2183323-FEZ_Inputs.jpg 500w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/15/156864/2183323-FEZ_Inputs.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/15/156864/2183323-FEZ_Inputs.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>There are glyphs composed of <a href=\"/tetromino/3055-1722/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1722\">tetrominos</a> which represent controller inputs.

These demo tracks were <a href=\"http://polytroncorporation.com/fez-music\" rel=\"nofollow\">released</a> on Polytron's website.

Navigation of these obstacles requires extremely precise timing to pass. Failure means instant death and a quick restart from the beginning of the level. The player is given an infinite amount of lives and near-instantaneous respawns, but Meat Boy leaves a trail of blood to mark where he has been and what obstacles previously killed him. When a regular level is completed, a <a href=\"/instant-replay/3015-45/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-45\">replay</a> showcases every attempt within the level simultaneously.</p><p>Characters have two abilities at their disposal: a <a href=\"/jump/3015-379/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-379\">jump</a> button and an ability button. For Meat Boy (and most other characters), pressing the ability button engages sprinting. Some characters sprint automatically and replace the ability button with another power, such as <a href=\"/tim/3005-5730/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-5730\">Tim's</a> ability to rewind time or <a href=\"/viridian/3005-16930/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-16930\">Viridian's</a> ability to inverse his own personal gravity. To keep the difficulty in check, the game features extremely precise controls. Quickly tapping the jump button performs a small hop, while holding down the jump button performs a tall leap. Players can also stick to the wall (which may either slow their descent or slightly continue their ascent) and press the jump button again for a <a href=\"/wall-jump/3015-5/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5\">wall jump</a>. Some unlockable characters have special jumping abilities, such as <a href=\"/the-kid/3005-16987/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-16987\">the Kid's</a> ability to double jump and <a href=\"/jill/3005-16969/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-16969\">Jill's</a> ability to stall her descent.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1283745-supermeatboy_release_2010_01_11_01_00_17_28.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1283745\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1283745-supermeatboy_release_2010_01_11_01_00_17_28.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1283745\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/26/1283745-supermeatboy_release_2010_01_11_01_00_17_28.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1283745-supermeatboy_release_2010_01_11_01_00_17_28.png 1280w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/26/1283745-supermeatboy_release_2010_01_11_01_00_17_28.png 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/1283745-supermeatboy_release_2010_01_11_01_00_17_28.png 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/26/1283745-supermeatboy_release_2010_01_11_01_00_17_28.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/26/1283745-supermeatboy_release_2010_01_11_01_00_17_28.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1283745-supermeatboy_release_2010_01_11_01_00_17_28.png 1280w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/26/1283745-supermeatboy_release_2010_01_11_01_00_17_28.png 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/1283745-supermeatboy_release_2010_01_11_01_00_17_28.png 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/26/1283745-supermeatboy_release_2010_01_11_01_00_17_28.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Over the course of the game, new mechanics are introduced and obstacles become more complex. These include rising tides of lava, portals, magnetic fields, fans, lava rocks, and eventually enemies that hunt down the player character. All obstacles will result in instantaneous death upon contact. The \"<a href=\"/bosses/3015-229/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-229\">bosses</a>\" are equally indestructible; instead of actually fighting them, these levels require players to navigate difficult puzzles under time restraints until a <a href=\"/cutscene/3015-22/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-22\">cutscene</a> is triggered.</p><p>Players can also collect bandages scattered around certain levels to unlock characters and certain levels. In order for the player to keep Bandages, they must collect them and successfully reach the exit in one attempt. Some bandages require specific characters and all are difficult to collect, especially in the purple Warp Zones, where players must not only collect the Bandage, but clear each of the three levels with a limited number of lives.</p><h2>Levels</h2><p>Super Meat Boy features five main worlds, each with forty regular levels. The initial twenty levels are referred to as the \"Light World\". If the player is able to clear a Light World level under its par time, they will be able to access the \"Dark World\" counterpart (which shares the same basic geometry, but has a different appearance and increased difficulty). Each Light World version of the five main worlds also include a boss level, which must be completed in order to progress to the next world. Boss levels are unlocked after the player beats 17 out of the 20 Light World levels.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1406229-supermeatboy_esrb_nyrt_720p30_st_66.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1406229\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1406229-supermeatboy_esrb_nyrt_720p30_st_66.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1406229\"><img alt=\"Meat Boy entering a Warp Zone. \" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/669/1406229-supermeatboy_esrb_nyrt_720p30_st_66.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1406229-supermeatboy_esrb_nyrt_720p30_st_66.jpg 1280w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/669/1406229-supermeatboy_esrb_nyrt_720p30_st_66.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1406229-supermeatboy_esrb_nyrt_720p30_st_66.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/669/1406229-supermeatboy_esrb_nyrt_720p30_st_66.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Meat Boy entering a Warp Zone. \" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/669/1406229-supermeatboy_esrb_nyrt_720p30_st_66.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1406229-supermeatboy_esrb_nyrt_720p30_st_66.jpg 1280w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/669/1406229-supermeatboy_esrb_nyrt_720p30_st_66.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1406229-supermeatboy_esrb_nyrt_720p30_st_66.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/669/1406229-supermeatboy_esrb_nyrt_720p30_st_66.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Meat Boy entering a Warp Zone. </figcaption></figure><p>Along the way, players can also find purple <a href=\"/warp-zone/3015-804/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-804\">Warp Zones</a> within certain levels. These portals vanish after a set period of time during the level attempt, though reaching these portals makes the Warp Zone available in the level selection screen. Entering a Warp Zone will transport Meat Boy (regardless of which character reaches the warp zone) to a retro-themed zone which is notably difficult. Each zone comes with three levels that must be completed consecutively with a special version of Meat Boy. Bandages are found within these warp zones, but the player will only have three attempts per level to collect them and clear the Warp Zone. If Meat Boy dies during the final attempt at any level, all bandages found during the Warp Zone attempt will be reset, and the player will be kicked back to the level selection screen. Replays and par times are unavailable for Warp Zones.</p><p>Red Warp Zones function similarly to purple Warp Zones but are played instead with a secret character. There are no bandages in red warp zones but there are also unlimited lives. There are only five red warp zones, one in each of the main Light Worlds. Each main world also has a special \"<a href=\"/glitch/3015-511/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-511\">glitch</a> zone\", reached by getting to Bandage Girl while she is in a randomly occurring \"glitch state\". Glitch zones feature no bandages and only one level, which is typically longer and more difficult than any of the world's Warp Zones.</p><h3>Chapter 1: The Forest</h3><p><strong>Intro Cutscene Tribute:</strong> <a href=\"../../street-fighter-ii/61-243/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Street Fighter II: The World Warrior</a></p><p><strong>Boss:</strong> Lil' Slugger (giant walking chainsaw driven by Dr. Fetus)</p><p>The Forest introduces buzzsaws, static sawblade launchers, and impassable tiles that crumble away soon after the player touches it.</p><h3>Chapter 2: The Hospital</h3><p><strong>Intro Cutscene Tribute:</strong> <a href=\"../../castlevania/61-6673/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Castlevania</a></p><p><strong>Boss:</strong> <a href=\"/chad/3005-15923/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-15923\">C.H.A.D.</a> (mutated living abomination of blood and tissue)</p><p>The Hospital introduces fans, crawling slimes that stick to surfaces, floating enemies that bounce around aimlessly, piles of deadly needles, keys that unlock certain tiles, and timed laser beams.</p><h3>Chapter 3: The Salt Factory</h3><p><strong>Intro Cutscene Tribute:</strong> <a href=\"../../the-adventures-of-lolo/61-5026/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Adventures of Lolo</a></p><p><strong>Boss:</strong> <a href=\"/brownie/3005-17017/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-17017\">Brownie</a></p><p>The Salt Factory introduces harmful salt, homing missile launchers, moving platforms, tiles that only crumble away after coming in to contact with a missile, and high-speed conveyor belts.</p><h3>Chapter 4: Hell</h3><p><strong>Intro Cutscene Tribute:</strong> <a href=\"../../ninja-gaiden/61-1653/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ninja Gaiden</a></p><p><strong>Boss:</strong> <a href=\"/little-horn/3005-17018/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-17018\">Little Horn</a> (monster made of Meat Boy corpses)</p><p>Hell introduces lava pits (that sometimes rise), moving lava rocks, portals, rotating eyes that slowly lock on to the player while shooting laser beams, and demon homing missiles that split in to separate small missiles on impact.</p><h3>Chapter 5: Rapture</h3><p><strong>Intro Cutscene Tribute:</strong> <a href=\"../../mega-man-2/61-14026/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mega Man 2</a></p><p><strong>Boss:</strong> Larrie's Lament (a group of enormous carnivorous worms)</p><p>Rapture introduces orbs that repulse the player, abominations (both running and flying) that head towards the player, and homing sawblade launchers.</p><h3>Chapter 6: The End</h3><p><strong>Intro Cutscene Tribute:</strong> <a href=\"/pokemon-redblue/3030-3966/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-3966\">Pok\u00e9mon Red/Blue</a></p><p><strong>Boss:</strong> <a href=\"/dr-fetus/3005-15922/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-15922\">Dr. Fetus</a></p><p>Unlocked after completing Chapter 5, The End includes five regular levels (with both Light World and Dark World variations) that can only be played by Meat Boy and are designed to test the player's mastery of previous concepts.

data-ref-id=\"3030-20655\">Battlefield: Bad Company</a>), the game features land, sea, and air warfare (in its classic <a href=\"/conquest-mode/3015-1099/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1099\">Conquest</a> game

The game uses the <a href=\"/conquest-mode/3015-1099/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1099\">Conquest mode</a> where players traverse the map capturing flags for their team. Every time a soldier is killed, their team loses a ticket, which is similar to reinforcements. When one team has the majority of flags (at least 3), the other team will slowly begin to lose tickets. Players have three classes to choose from when spawning. The Rifleman class uses a semi-automatic <a href=\"/rifle/3055-545/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-545\">rifle</a> and can shoot rifle grenades. The Infantry class carries a <a href=\"/submachine-gun/3055-766/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-766\">submachine gun</a> and also has an <a href=\"/bazooka/3055-2394/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2394\">anti-tank weapon</a> for destroying vehicles and structures (thanks to the <a href=\"/frostbite-engine/3015-1095/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1095\">Frostbite</a> engine). Finally, the Scout class has a <a href=\"/sniper-rifle/3055-67/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-67\">sniper rifle</a> for picking off troops and can also plant <a href=\"/dynamite/3055-390/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-390\">dynamite</a> along roads to blow up vehicles. A surprising feature of the game is every weapon having unlimited ammo. Rockets, grenades, and dynamite are also unlimited but after the player has exhausted their initial supply they must wait a few seconds for it to respawn. The player can also \"reload\" their supply of rockets by taking out the rockets and hitting the reload button. In addition to having unlimited ammunition is the regenerating health system that the game uses.</p><p>Along with the classes, players have multiple vehicles at their disposal. The newest addition to the console versions of <a href=\"/battlefield/3025-51/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-51\">Battlefield</a> is planes. On two of the three maps, both teams start out on <a href=\"/aircraft-carrier/3055-1902/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1902\">aircraft carriers</a> with two planes that <a href=\"/respawn/3015-989/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-989\">respawn</a> after a certain period of time. Because the game is set in <a href=\"/world-war-ii/3015-471/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-471\">World War II</a>, the planes only come equipped with machine guns and bombs to drop on the battlefield. Each map also has an airfield that players can capture that spawns planes and other vehicles. (Should the player need to bail out of their airplane, they can do so safely due to the inclusion of parachutes). The game also includes <a href=\"/tank/3055-92/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-92\">tanks</a>, which are good for assaulting flags and taking out infantry, and <a href=\"/jeep/3055-884/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-884\">jeeps</a>, which are ideal for getting from one place to another quickly. The aircraft carriers have <a href=\"/boat/3055-804/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-804\">boats</a> for the players who don't take off in planes, and the occasional boat can be found docked along the islands. Throughout their time with the game, players can earn stamps and postcards based on their performance and for performing certain feats. (Getting 10,000 kills will earn you one). They have no practical use.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1379/941824-8.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-941824\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.56289308176101\" data-width=\"954\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 954px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1379/941824-8.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-941824\"><img alt=\"Planes can be pretty useful during a match\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1379/941824-8.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1379/941824-8.jpg 954w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1379/941824-8.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1379/941824-8.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Planes can be pretty useful during a match\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1379/941824-8.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1379/941824-8.jpg 954w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1379/941824-8.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1379/941824-8.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Planes can be pretty useful during a match</figcaption></figure><p>Another new feature is the ability to launch an air raid. Each of the three maps has a special bunker that a player can enter. When they do, they become invulnerable and get to control a squadron of bombers that fly over the battlefield. While heading towards the island, the player can steer the fleet over a target. Once they are over it, they unleash the bombs, usually taking out several soldiers at once. The bombers can be shot down by enemy planes and AA guns, but it takes many hits. Doing so will lower the amount of bombs that can be dropped. Players may also notice a symbol on the battlefield: two crossed rifles. This is the Frontline icon, and it shows where most of the fighting is. Players can use this to their advantage when calling in an air raid.</p><p>Much like previous games, players can join a squad with other teammates. The squad leader can look at a flag and put a bright red circle around it for their squad to see. This is useful for telling teammates who aren't using a headset where they should go.</p><table><tbody><tr><th>Class</th><th>Weapon</th><th>Equipment</th><th>Melee</th></tr><tr><td>Rifleman</td><td><a

Using the Roblox editor, users can use LEGO-like bricks to create worlds or objects, and create scripts to create game rules or player abilities. To get users to come to their place, the player can advertise their Places in the Roblox website by using Robux.</p><h3>Economy</h3><p>The game is composed of one currency, R<i>obux</i>. The <i>robux</i> is the currency for paying players and is what most of the game's items use. Paying Builder's Club members get an allowance of <i>robux</i> each day, the amount depending on their subscription.</p>", "expected_release_day": 11, "expected_release_month": 2, "expected_release_quarter": null, "expected_release_year": 2005, "guid": "3030-25462", "id": 25462, "image": {"icon_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/2956731-box_roblox.png", "medium_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_medium/2956731-box_roblox.png", "screen_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/screen_medium/2956731-box_roblox.png", "screen_large_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/screen_kubrick/2956731-box_roblox.png", "small_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_small/2956731-box_roblox.png", "super_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_large/2956731-box_roblox.png", "thumb_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_avatar/2956731-box_roblox.png", "tiny_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_mini/2956731-box_roblox.png", "original_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/2956731-box_roblox.png", "image_tags": "All Images"}, "image_tags": [{"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-25462/?filter=image_tag%3AAll+Images", "name": "All Images", "total": 9}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-25462/?filter=image_tag%3AScreenshots", "name": "Screenshots", "total": 4}], "name": "ROBLOX", "number_of_user_reviews": 0, "original_game_rating": [{"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-29/", "id": 29, "name": "ESRB: E10+"}], "original_release_date": null, "platforms": [{"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-17/", "id": 17, "name": "Mac", "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/mac/3045-17/", "abbreviation": "MAC"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-94/", "id": 94, "name": "PC", "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/", "abbreviation": "PC"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-96/", "id": 96, "name": "iPhone", "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/iphone/3045-96/", "abbreviation": "IPHN"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-121/", "id": 121, "name": "iPad", "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/ipad/3045-121/", "abbreviation": "IPAD"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-123/", "id": 123, "name": "Android", "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/android/3045-123/", "abbreviation": "ANDR"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-145/", "id": 145, "name": "Xbox One", "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-one/3045-145/", "abbreviation": "XONE"}], "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/roblox/3030-25462/"}, {"aliases": null, "api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-25526/", "date_added": "2009-03-06 11:49:51", "date_last_updated": "2019-07-02 13:53:18", "deck": "Game for iPod touch and iPhone platforms.

When a level is completed as Luigi, a Ghost Luigi will appear representing the developer's \"speed run\" that players can race against for completion times or sometimes he will show Mario neat tricks and secrets. Once Bowser has been beaten in World 6, Luigi is unlocked and able to be used on every level of the game.</p><p>Unlike in previous 3D Mario games, levels are not accessible through areas in the game's <a href=\"/hub-world/3015-1855/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1855\">hub world</a>. Instead, players navigate with a <a href=\"/\">Super Mario Bros. 3</a>-style map. This map is accessed via the wheel of Starship Mario, an explorable space containing NPCs and hidden power-ups. New levels on the map must be unlocked using Power Stars collected during levels. Coins and star bits can open secret areas on the map, while hidden Comet Medals are used to unlock more difficult challenges.</p><p>If the levels are completed manually without the help of the <a href=\"/super-guide/3015-4045/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4045\">Cosmic Guide</a>, the player will earn <a href=\"/power-stars/3055-3898/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-3898\">Power Star</a>s which are used to unlock more levels. If the player uses the help of the Cosmic Guide, they will only receive a Bronze Star, which aren't as useful as the Power Stars as they do not unlock more levels or worlds.

Nintendo later added Yoshi in this game. He's trapped in a Yoshi egg in some Galaxies, Mario and Luigi can smack it open to free him, then they can ride him.</p><p>He runs faster than the plumbers and are not effected by muddy surfaces that would slow down the player otherwise, his iconic move, the Flutter Jump makes a return, a move that really boost airtime. Yoshi can also use his long tongue to gobble up fruits and enemies, eating enemies will turn them into Star Bits. Aim at something with the remote and press B to eat it; larger objects requires him to hold B and move Yoshi away from it to drag it loose then eat it. (Example of this is Piranha Plants). He can also use his tongue to grab on floating flowers, which he then can use to swing to the other side.</p><p>If Mario takes a hit while on Yoshi, he's tossed off and Yoshi starts to runs around in panic, Mario have to jump back on or Spin nearby him to ride him again. If left alone for too long Yoshi returns to his egg. Falling into space or getting electrocuted will make Yoshi return to his egg immediately.</p><p>As mentioned before, Yoshi can eat all kind of fruits in this game, and each one has a different effect on him.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/111937/1739052-mario_galaxy_2_yoshi_powers.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1739052\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.79118889559445\" data-width=\"1657\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1657px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:79.1%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/111937/1739052-mario_galaxy_2_yoshi_powers.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1739052\"><img alt=\"Yoshi's fruit powers\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/111937/1739052-mario_galaxy_2_yoshi_powers.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/111937/1739052-mario_galaxy_2_yoshi_powers.png 1657w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/11/111937/1739052-mario_galaxy_2_yoshi_powers.png 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/111937/1739052-mario_galaxy_2_yoshi_powers.png 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/111937/1739052-mario_galaxy_2_yoshi_powers.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Yoshi's fruit powers\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/111937/1739052-mario_galaxy_2_yoshi_powers.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/11/111937/1739052-mario_galaxy_2_yoshi_powers.png 1657w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/11/111937/1739052-mario_galaxy_2_yoshi_powers.png 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/11/111937/1739052-mario_galaxy_2_yoshi_powers.png 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/11/111937/1739052-mario_galaxy_2_yoshi_powers.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Yoshi's fruit powers</figcaption></figure><ul><li><b>Red Berry</b>: All over the place in most Yoshi stages, he gets Star Bits every time he eats one, eat ten to earn a 1UP.</li><li><b>Flotacius Blimp Fruit</b>: A blue, balloon like fruit, it turns Yoshi into a balloon which allows him and Mario to float up for a short time, he can hold \"A\" to stop rising, and shake the remote to cancel the move early.</li><li><b>Bulb Berry</b>: Found in dark areas, eating one will make a light zone around Yoshi for a limited time, invisible platforms and objects will become visible and useable if within this light zone.</li><li><b>Red Dash Pepper</b>: Eating one will set Yoshi's mouth on fire for awhile, in this state he can't stop running in great speed, he can still control his direction and jumps though.

It was the debut title in the long-running <a href=\"/punch-out/3025-428/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-428\">Punch-Out</a> franchise and featured the first appearance of many characters who have remained featured in the series since then.</p><p>This was the first <a href=\"/boxer/3015-13/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-13\">boxing</a> game, and the first <a href=\"/hand-to-hand-combat/3015-288/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-288\">hand-to-hand combat</a> game in general, to become popular enough to launch its own franchise. It was a technical breakthrough, for its large, detailed, colourful <a href=\"/sprite/3015-491/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-491\">sprites</a>, and 480p resolution using a <a href=\"/dual-monitor-arcade-games/3015-3686/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3686\">dual-monitor</a> setup. It introduced several gameplay innovations, such as an <a href=\"/over-the-shoulder/3015-2621/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2621\">over-the-shoulder</a> perspective and the <a href=\"/stamina-bar/3015-3569/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3569\">player stamina meter</a>, <a href=\"/enemy-health-indicator/3015-6203/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6203\">enemy stamina meter</a>, <a href=\"/regenerating-health/3015-83/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-83\">recharging health</a> and <a href=\"/dodge/3015-2476/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2476\">dodging</a> mechanics.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>The player controls an unnamed green-haired boxer who is displayed from a behind-the-back view as a green wire-frame during gameplay - this was done to allow the player to see the opponent more easily. The player can throw high and low / right and left punches using two buttons in combination with the joystick, as well as press a third, larger button that is used for a \"super punch\" - either an uppercut or hook - when the player fills an on-screen meter via landing multiple normal punches. The player must quickly react to visual cues from the opponent in order to block or dodge incoming punches.</p><p>The player works their way through a series of opponents until they earn the right to face the world champion, Mr. Sandman. Like many arcade games from the same era, Punch-Out!! does not have a true ending. If the player progresses through all of the boxers and manages to win the world title, the game starts them over at the first opponent again. The second time through the green wireframe character is yellow, and the opponents have different colored attire and display more complex and dangerous techniques.</p><p>Unlike the later home games in the Punch-Out!! franchise, there is only one round per fight. The player must KO his opponent within that one round. If the time expires it goes to a \"decision\" which results in a loss for the player. Although there is technically no TKO win condition in the game, three knockdowns (either to the opponent or player) will result in a knockout.</p><h2>Opponents</h2><p>In order of appearance:</p><ul><li><a href=\"/glass-joe/3005-278/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-278\"> Glass Joe</a></li><li><a href=\"/piston-hurricane/3005-143/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-143\"> Piston Hurricane</a></li><li><a href=\"/bald-bull/3005-60/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-60\"> Bald Bull</a></li><li><a href=\"/kid-quick/3005-10458/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-10458\"> Kid Quick</a></li><li><a href=\"/pizza-pasta/3005-10457/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-10457\"> Pizza Pasta</a></li><li><a href=\"/mr-sandman/3005-166/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-166\"> Mr. Sandman</a> (champion)</li></ul><h2>Technical Information</h2><p>The Punch-Out!! arcade cabinet was somewhat unique in that it used two monitors - one in the standard arcade cabinet position for the field of play and another monitor above it that displayed game data like player/opponent portraits as well as health meters.</p><p>Punch-Out!! also featured <a href=\"/speech-synthesis/3015-3801/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3801\">digitized speech</a> that served multiple purposes, an announcer introduced the opponents before a fight as well as called the action on the fly during a bout (ie \"Right! Right! Left! Bodyblow! He's down for the count!\") and gave an audio cue to the player when their super meter was full (\"Put him away!\" or \"Knock him out!\"). The announcer also encourages the player to \"Come on, stand up and fight!\" after a defeat. Other brief samples were used for boxer voices, mainly just grunts when the player was hit by an opponent and a laugh that would be heard when the player was knocked out by the computer opponent.</p><h2>Legacy</h2><p>Punch-Out had an arcade sequel,<a href=\"/super-punch-out/3030-26551/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-26551\"> Super Punch-Out!!</a> It spawned several home console titles bearing the Punch-Out name with a similar (although not identical) gameplay style. It even had an arcade spin-off <a href=\"/arm-wrestling/3030-26552/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-26552\"> Arm Wrestling</a> (which featured Bald Bull as a masked opponent named Mask X). Punch-Out!! is generally regarded as one of the original iconic Nintendo franchises, although not at the level of Mario or Zelda titles.</p><p>The 1984 <a href=\"/game-watch/3025-1183/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1183\">Game &amp; Watch</a> handheld game Boxing, developed by <a href=\"/nintendo-rd1/3010-928/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-928\">Nintendo R&amp;D1</a>, was called Punch-Out in North America.

There is also very little music throughout the game, with it only being heard in specific locations and maintaining the minimalist approach in its composition. The game also contains no loading screens, and can be played continuously from start to finish without pause. It was released on July 21st, 2010, the first game to appear on <a data-ref-id=\"3015-5553\" href=\"/summer-of-arcade-2010/3015-5553/\">Xbox Live's Summer of Arcade 2010</a>.</p><p>The story in <i>Limbo</i> is never properly detailed in the game.

The game only uses two buttons in addition to movement controls, one to cause the boy to jump, and one for contextual action, such as dragging boxes, pulling levers, or pushing buttons. The boy can grab onto ledges within reach and lower himself from platforms, climb ladders, push and pull objects and also swing from ropes found in the environment. <i>Limbo</i> features a lot of what developer Playdead describes as \"trial and death\" gameplay, requiring players to die frequently (and gruesomely) in order to fully understand the puzzles. <i>Limbo</i> has an extremely generous checkpoint system with almost instantaneous reloading, usually bringing the boy back to <i>just</i> before he set off a trap or fell into a chasm, minimizing (but not avoiding) player frustration.</p><p><i>Limbo</i> focuses mostly on physics-based puzzles. These puzzles involve the player pulling or pushing objects with true momentum, affecting fluids, and manipulating electromagnetism and gravity to move objects as well as the player. The game introduces a number of different types of puzzles as the game progresses. A frequent puzzle element involves brain slugs which burrow into the boy's head and force him to walk forward, leaving him unable to stop or turn around until he walks into a bright light, which harms the brain slug and makes it turn him around to flee back into the dark. When afflicted by a slug, previously benign areas and easily-avoidable hazards turn into horrific obstacle courses and death traps.</p><h2>Environments</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1404042-limbo_esrb_t_720p30_st_6300kbps_24.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1404042\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 1280px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1404042-limbo_esrb_t_720p30_st_6300kbps_24.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1404042\"><img alt=\"Nice and safe in this huge, creepy forest.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1404042-limbo_esrb_t_720p30_st_6300kbps_24.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1404042-limbo_esrb_t_720p30_st_6300kbps_24.jpg 1280w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/669/1404042-limbo_esrb_t_720p30_st_6300kbps_24.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1404042-limbo_esrb_t_720p30_st_6300kbps_24.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Nice and safe in this huge, creepy forest.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1404042-limbo_esrb_t_720p30_st_6300kbps_24.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1404042-limbo_esrb_t_720p30_st_6300kbps_24.jpg 1280w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/669/1404042-limbo_esrb_t_720p30_st_6300kbps_24.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1404042-limbo_esrb_t_720p30_st_6300kbps_24.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Nice and safe in this huge, creepy forest.</figcaption></figure><p><i>Limbo</i>'s environments change as the protagonist journeys through a number of different locations throughout the game. The player plays straight through these environments without any pause or loading screens.</p><p><b>The Forest</b></p><p>The first environment of the game. The boy first wakes up in the forest where he then continues on to cross a large river on a boat, battle against the giant spider and first encounter the psychotic natives of <i>Limbo</i>, who appear to be murderous children. The Forest covers the first four chapters of the game. The Forest area has no industrial traits and differs quite a bit from locations in the game's later chapters.</p><p><b>Wasteland</b></p><p>The environment then begins to change when the player meets the murderous children. In the background, broken old shacks and trees are seen. Objects that are used in the environment are broken objects like old crates. Crows are seen perched on the old buildings. The player encounters violence from the natives in this area of the game. They chase the boy, trying to kill him using their darts. There are various wooden structures seen throughout this area, obviously built by the natives. Forestry from the opening environment can be seen dotted around the area. The brain slugs, which force their host to walk in one direction only, make their first appearance in this area.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1404052-limbo_esrb_t_720p30_st_6300kbps_34.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1404052\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 1280px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1404052-limbo_esrb_t_720p30_st_6300kbps_34.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1404052\"><img alt=\"The game's areas begin to degrade.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1404052-limbo_esrb_t_720p30_st_6300kbps_34.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1404052-limbo_esrb_t_720p30_st_6300kbps_34.jpg 1280w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/669/1404052-limbo_esrb_t_720p30_st_6300kbps_34.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1404052-limbo_esrb_t_720p30_st_6300kbps_34.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The game's areas begin to degrade.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1404052-limbo_esrb_t_720p30_st_6300kbps_34.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1404052-limbo_esrb_t_720p30_st_6300kbps_34.jpg 1280w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/669/1404052-limbo_esrb_t_720p30_st_6300kbps_34.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1404052-limbo_esrb_t_720p30_st_6300kbps_34.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The game's areas begin to degrade.</figcaption></figure><p><b>The Caves</b></p><p>The wasteland areas then move into the caves. The caves' main theme is water. Many of the puzzles seen throughout the caves involve using water to advance and also trying to avoid drowning in said water, as the boy appears to be soluble. Many waterfalls can also be seen in the backgrounds of some areas in the caves. The caves are also the first area of the game where the player goes indoors. The industrial traits of the game begin to appear here. Cogs, levers and metal platforms are seen in the caves, replacing the old wooden structures of the wasteland area.</p><p><b>The Hotel</b></p><p>This is the first area of the game to involve a modern/urban theme. When players first enter this environment, they are greeted by a large \"HOTEL\" sign which must be navigated over to continue. The player then breaks into the hotel via a glass ceiling and continues on their journey. This environment contains puzzles involving elevators and electricity. After the player travels through the Hotel, they exit back outside for a short time before entering the next enviroment, the Industrial Mill.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1404055-limbo_esrb_t_720p30_st_6300kbps_37.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1404055\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 1280px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1404055-limbo_esrb_t_720p30_st_6300kbps_37.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1404055\"><img alt=\"The \"HOTEL\" sign.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1404055-limbo_esrb_t_720p30_st_6300kbps_37.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1404055-limbo_esrb_t_720p30_st_6300kbps_37.jpg 1280w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/669/1404055-limbo_esrb_t_720p30_st_6300kbps_37.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1404055-limbo_esrb_t_720p30_st_6300kbps_37.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The \"></noscript></a><figcaption>The \"HOTEL\" sign.</figcaption></figure><p><b>Industrial Mill</b></p><p>This is the final environment in the game and takes up the most chapters and most of the latter parts of <i>Limbo</i>. There are a number of different concepts which appear here, navigating cogs, gravity puzzles, spinning rooms, avoiding fire from incongruously-placed machine gun turrets, and using electrical magnets. The Industrial Mill differs greatly from the Forest area at the beginning of the game. This area contains less of the strange atmosphere which defines the early part of the game, and focuses more on puzzle-solving then building atmosphere. Once the player breaks free from the mill, by blasting their way through a glass window, they are greeted with the final moment of the game.</p><p><b>Secret Underground Level</b></p><p>A hidden area that can only be accessed after finishing the game and finding all of the other eggs, the majority of this area is entirely in darkness, forcing the player to navigate by sound alone. It is one of the most difficult sections of the game. It was added to the PS3 and PC releases, and is tied to the \" <a data-ref-id=\"ding\" href=\"/achievements/ding/116706/\">Ding!</a>\" trophy/achievement. It has not been patched into the 360 release, to punish 360 players for getting the game first.</p><h2>Ending</h2><p>The ending to <i>Limbo</i> is quite abrupt and is open to much interpretation. After finishing the final puzzle, the boy is thrown through a pane of glass. On the other side, the boy finds himself in the forest once again. After travelling for a moment, the boy comes across a young girl, the only female seen in the game, and most likely his sister, outside of a treehouse. When the young girl sees the boy, she stands up. The game then abruptly ends and the credits begin to roll. When they player is returned to the main menu, they realize that the scene which has always accompanied the main menu upon loading the game depicts the same area as the ending, but with a decrepit treehouse and flies buzzing around something on the ground, with the most cynical interpretation being that it is the corpses of the boy and his sister.</p><p>The ending of the game has a number of interpretations that can be drawn from the proceedings. Since the game is named <i>Limbo</i>, it is reasonable to assume that the game's dream-like world is the religious idea of <a data-ref-id=\"3015-5751\" href=\"/limbo/3015-5751/\">limbo</a>. It is believed by some that the boy completes his journey by returning to the place where he once started; a single circular loop, like limbo itself. Some believe that the two children have already died, hence the menu screen, and that meeting each other in the end is the last task they must complete before they can continue to the afterlife. A number of theories exist on the matter and the developers of <i>Limbo</i> have said nothing officially on the subject of the ending.</p><h2>Reception</h2><p><i>Limbo</i> has received very positive critical acclaim. Reviewers applauded the game's graphical and audio presentation as they have not been seen in many games before. <i>Limbo</i>'s \"noir\" qualities are also a common plus point for many reviewers. Some reviewers praised the game's lack of a proper narrative and that it is shrouded in mystery, but many found this lack of narrative unappealing. A common criticism made on message boards and in reviews was due to the lack of value for the initial $15 asking price. Such complaints were levied against the linearity of the title, the short length (most players are able to complete it in about three hours), and the lack of replay value endemic to puzzle-platformers. Some reviews noted the game's second half abandoned the initial focus on ambience and organic placement of game elements in favour of the introduction of new mechanics and disjointed puzzle areas, leaving the player with an unoriginal yet still technically well-executed platformer. <i>Limbo</i> has scores of 90% and 92% on GameRankings and Metacritic respectively. <a data-ref-id=\"3040-89869\" href=\"/brad-shoemaker/3040-89869/\">Brad Shoemaker</a> awarded the game a maximum five stars and included it in his game of the year list.</p><h2>Avatar Awards</h2><p><i>Limbo</i> has 2 <a data-ref-id=\"3015-3749\" href=\"/avatar-awards/3015-3749/\">avatar awards</a> to unlock in the Xbox 360 version.</p><ul><li>White Logo T-Shirt - Earn your first achievement</li><li>A Creature from Limbo (prop) - Complete the game</li></ul><h2>Acclaim</h2><ul><li><i>Limbo</i> was awarded the \"Excellence in Visual Arts\" and \"Technical Excellence\" awards at the 2010 Independent Games Festival.</li><li><i>Limbo</i> has also won 3 Milthons at the 2010 <a href=\"http://www.milthon.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">European Games Awards</a> including the one for <a href=\"http://www.milthon.com/palmares-2010.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Game of the Year</a>.</li><li>Voted \"Best Indie Game\" in <a href=\"http://blog.us.playstation.com/2012/03/06/2012-psn-gamers-choice-awards-and-the-winners-are/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Playstation Network's Gamers' Choice Awards 2012</a> (voted online by the community), and went on sale for 30% off (50% off for Playstation Plus Members).</li></ul><h2>PC System Requirements</h2><ul><li><strong>Operating System:</strong> Windows XP, Vista, 7</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> 2 GHz</li><li><strong>RAM Memory:</strong> 512MB</li><li><strong>Hard Disk Space:</strong> 150MB</li><li><strong>Video Card:</strong> 5 years or younger.

The game supports <a href=\"/online/3015-559/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-559\">online multiplayer</a> and later supported numerous content packs (including new world/block textures and player skins, many of which are <a href=\"/crossover/3015-732/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-732\">cross-promotions</a> with other games and franchises).</p><p>Originally created by indie developer <a href=\"/markus-persson/3040-97855/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-97855\">Markus \"Notch\" Persson</a> (whose roles were later taken over by fellow indie developer <a href=\"/jens-bergensten/3040-99838/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-99838\">Jens \"Jeb\" Bergensten</a>), Minecraft was ported to numerous smartphones (originally known as <em>Minecraft: Pocket Edition</em>) and consoles (originally known as <em>Minecraft: Console Edition</em>, where the \"Console\" in the name was replaced by the console's name). On September 20, 2017, the game received a major \"Better Together\" update that merges the smartphone version with some console versions (including Windows 10, <a href=\"/xbox-one/3045-145/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-145\">Xbox One</a>, and later <a href=\"/nintendo-switch/3045-157/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-157\">Nintendo Switch</a>) together for a single multi-platform version (known simply as <em>Minecraft</em>, with the original computer versions renamed to <em>Minecraft: Java Edition</em>) with all features accessible (including <a href=\"/cross-platform-multiplayer/3015-4183/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4183\">cross-platform multiplayer</a>). Alternate editions include a multi-platform version for use in classroom settings (<em>Minecraft: Education Edition</em>), a cut-down version for small <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi\" data-target=\"true\" data-nofollow=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Raspberry Pi</a> microcomputers (<em>Minecraft: Pi Edition</em>), and a multi-platform version for use in <a href=\"/china/3035-343/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-343\">China</a> (<em>Minecraft China</em>).</p><p>The game received some <a href=\"/spin-off/3015-1100/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1100\">spin-offs</a>, including the 2015 adventure game <a href=\"/minecraft-story-mode/3030-48413/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-48413\">Minecraft: Story Mode</a> (and <a href=\"/minecraft-story-mode-season-2/3030-59826/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-59826\">its 2017 sequel</a>), the upcoming dungeon crawler <a href=\"/minecraft-dungeons/3030-70421/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-70421\">Minecraft: Dungeons</a>, and the upcoming augmented-reality game <a href=\"/minecraft-earth/3030-73461/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-73461\">Minecraft Earth</a>. The game's procedurally-generated sandbox elements also inspired many game clones in both 2D (including <a href=\"/terraria/3030-34940/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-34940\">Terraria</a> and <a href=\"/starbound/3030-37839/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-37839\">Starbound</a>) and 3D (including <a href=\"/dragon-quest-builders/3030-50284/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-50284\">Dragon Quest Builders</a> and <a href=\"/lego-worlds/3030-49820/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-49820\">LEGO Worlds</a>).</p><h2>Versions</h2><h3>Original / Java Edition</h3><p>The original Minecraft, developed using custom engine in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)\" data-target=\"true\" data-nofollow=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Java</a>, had three major pre-release phases: pre-Alpha (from May 17, 2009 to June 30, 2010), Alpha (from June 30, 2010 to December 3, 2010), and Beta (from December 20, 2010 to November 11, 2011). Most of the versions in these phases (including some prior) can be played in the final release through the launcher.</p><p>While pre-Alpha builds were released for free as a <a href=\"/browser/3045-140/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-140\">browser</a>-based game (with some benefits for those with a premium membership), versions beginning with Alpha required both a standalone launcher and paid authentication.</p><ul><li>The first pre-Alpha versions, which began on May 17, 2009 and was later called \"Classic\", originally lacked survival elements (making it a primitive version of the \"Creative\" game mode), and had restricted randomly-generated terrain (surrounded by endless ocean). Online multiplayer was added on May 31, 2009. An alternate single-player version with basic survival elements (such as enemy mobs, a health system, and a basic bow-and-arrow system) was added on September 1, 2009 and updated alongside the regular version.</li></ul><ul><li>The second pre-Alpha versions, which began on December 23, 2009 and was also called \"Indev\" (in-development), is based on the \"survival\" version of the above version and added a new dynamic lighting system, the crafting and inventory systems, optional map themes, specialized tools and weapons, a day-night cycle, and farming.</li></ul><ul><li>The last pre-Alpha versions, which began on February 27, 2010 and was also called called \"Infdev\" (\"infinite development\") revamped the terrain generator to allow \"infinite\" procedurally-generated terrain. In addition, this version adds more craftable items (including signs, ladders, doors, and minecarts) and more complex cave systems (including special dungeons).</li></ul><ul><li>The Alpha versions, which began on June 30, 2010, added online multiplayer, biomes, redstone circuitry, improved A.I. pathfinding, new block types (including stairs), and a new hidden realm (The Nether). Most of the updates were added as \"Seecret Friday\" updates, which intentionally left the changelog barren to let players find out what's changed.</li></ul><ul><li>The Beta versions, which began on December 20, 2010, added numerous block and mob types (including beds and tame-able wolves) while revamping the inventory system (making it harder for clients to hack) and adding both weather effects and achievements. One of the last major updates (also called the \"Adventure Update\", released on September 14, 2011), revamped the game's biome generation while adding new combat mechanics (such as <a href=\"/critical-hit/3015-97/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-97\">critical hits</a>), an <a href=\"/experience-points/3015-39/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-39\">experience system</a>, a <a href=\"/hunger/3015-677/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-677\">hunger system</a>, <a href=\"/sprinting/3015-603/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-603\">sprinting</a>, and new pre-generated structures (such as villages). The Adventure Update also adds a new Creative Mode.</li></ul><p>The game later received a full v1.0.0 release on November 18, 2011, and has received numerous post-release updates.

It was later included by default in installations of the Raspbian OS.</p><p>Despite its abandonment (as there have been no updates) and simplicity (with a cut-down version of Creative mode), this version is used as an educational tool for programmers, as it supports multiple programming languages for scripting.</p><h4>Minecraft: Education Edition</h4><p>Minecraft: Education Edition is a special variant of the <a href=\"/pc/3045-94/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">Windows 10</a> version for use in classroom teaching. Released on November 1, 2016 for eligible institutions (including schools, public libraries, and public museums), Education Edition allows educators to build lesson plans by restricting building/exploration, creating NPCs, spectating all students, and allowing students to document using screenshots (using unique Camera and Portfolio items).</p><p>It was later released to <a href=\"/iphone/3045-96/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-96\">iOS</a> on September 6, 2018.</p><h4>Minecraft China</h4><p>Minecraft China is a localized variant of the original \"Java Edition\" version of the game, released by <a href=\"/netease/3010-9597/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-9597\">NetEase</a> for the <a href=\"/pc/3045-94/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PC</a> on August 8, 2017. It was released as a freemium download with some altered functionality (relying on a new launcher created by NetEase and requiring a NetEase account).</p><p>Special Minecraft China variants of the <a href=\"/iphone/3045-96/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-96\">iOS</a> and <a href=\"/android/3045-123/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-123\">Android</a> versions were released shortly after (September 5, 2017 for iOS and October 12, 2017 for Android).</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Game Modes</h3><p>In Minecraft, the game has two main game modes: Survival and Creative. Server owners can switch between them using console commands.</p><p>In addition, server owners for some versions of the game can enable special <a href=\"/player-vs-player/3015-346/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-346\">player-vs-player</a> multiplayer minigames using custom maps.</p><h4>Survival</h4><p>Survival Mode is the base game mode of Minecraft, starting players empty in an open <a href=\"/randomly-generated-maps/3015-206/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-206\">procedurally-generated</a> world. Players must explore the world, collect resources, upgrade their gear, battle hostile mobs, and manage both their health and their <a href=\"/hunger/3015-677/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-677\">hunger</a>.</p><p>While the game has no <a href=\"/never-ending/3015-1467/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1467\">pre-determined goals</a>, players can work on the game's <a href=\"/achievements/3015-29/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-29\">achievements and advancements</a> (depending on both the game's version and whether these features are not voided due to server changes) and can build new structures to their heart's content.</p><p>While playing Survival Mode, players can choose from four difficulty levels for their world:</p><ul><li><strong>Peaceful</strong> - Hostile and potentially-hostile mobs cannot spawn naturally. Changing to this difficulty from others remove all hostile and potentially-hostile mobs from the world. The hunger meter cannot deplete.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Easy</strong> - Hostile mobs and potentially-hostile mobs can now spawn. When the hunger meter is fully depleted, the player's health begins to drain down until it reaches 50%.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Normal</strong> - Hostile mobs and explosions now deal additional damage to players. When the hunger meter is fully depleted, the player's health begins to drain down until it reaches 5%. Certain hostile mobs now have additional attacks. Villagers killed by Zombies have a 50% chance of becoming a Zombie.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Hard</strong> - Hostile mobs and explosions now deal even greater damage to players. When the hunger meter is fully depleted, the player's health begins to drain down to 0% (causing them to die from starvation). Certain mobs are now more likely to spawn with weapons and armor. Zombies can now break down doors and spawn reinforcements. Villagers killed by zombies now always become a Zombie.</li></ul><p>In addition, the Java Edition has a bonus <strong>Hardcore</strong> game mode, which locks the difficulty to Hard while disabling the Bonus Chest, cheat commands, and <a href=\"/permanent-death/3015-431/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-431\">the ability to respawn</a> after death (only allowing dead players to spectate the world).</p><h4>Creative</h4><p>Creative Mode allows players to build structures freely with no resource or inventory management, no crafting, no combat, and no health or hunger management. Players have an alternate inventory that allows them an infinite selection of almost all blocks and items in the game. They can also toggle <a href=\"/flight/3015-350/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-350\">the ability to fly around freely</a> by double-jumping.</p><h3>Starting Out</h3><p>When creating a new game in Minecraft, a world is generated and the player is spawned at a random spot. That spot is the player's spawn point and will remain their fixed spawn point until the player rests in a bed. From that point on the bed becomes their new spawn point. The world continues to generate around the player in all directions for a while, and as the player moves around the world more will be generated. The world is stored in 16x16 cubes of blocks, called chunks. The world is created of same-sized blocks. The most common of these are dirt, sand and stone. Everything in Minecraft revolves around obtaining these blocks, placing them in the world, and crafting them into useful items.</p><p>To collect blocks, the player left-clicks on a block and cracks will appear in it. If they continue to left-click until the cracks fill the block, the block will shatter dropping a miniature version of itself (or a particular material depending on the block type). The time it takes to collect a block depends on the block the player is collecting and the tool (if any) that they are using. Most mineral-based blocks will require the proper tool to be harvested (stone will not yield cobblestone unless mined with a pick, snow tiles will not yield snowballs unless harvested with a shovel, etc.). Once collected, initial blocks will be placed into the player's hotbar (from left to right), with spillover collecting into the rest of the player's inventory. To place a block, equip it in the hotbar (with either the mouse wheel or corresponding number key) and right-click on another block. [NOTE: Some blocks when collected will yield an item instead of a block (such as diamond or coal) this item cannot be placed and right-click will do nothing.] Take care when using tools as using the incorrect tool on a specific block type will waste two uses of the tool instead of just one (for instance, using a pickaxe on a tree).</p><p>Collecting blocks is only the first part of playing Minecraft, then comes crafting, which is more important. In the inventory screen (Default hotkey: E) there is a 2x2 square grid used for crafting. To craft an item, the player must place the correct ingredients in the correct shape in the grid. Some items can be created with very simple diagrams (i.e. a single block of wood will create four wooden planks), while others can be very complicated. One very important early game craft is to create a workbench (which allows players to craft in a 3x3 square allowing them to create more advanced items). A workbench is created with four planks; one placed in each spot of the 2x2 grid.</p><p>Once players have crafted a workbench, the next step is crafting tools like shovels and axes. These allow players to gather blocks more quickly and collect more advanced blocks. After a player makes tools the rest of the game is up to them. Players can mine for rare ore, build elaborate structures and much more.</p><h3>Weather</h3><p>As of update 1.5, Minecraft has weather in the form of rain, snow and thunderstorms. Rain will occur, if rarely, in all biomes except desert, tundra and taiga, and snow will only fall in the tundra and taiga biomes, or at a certain altitude. Instances of both of these weather effects will last approximately 15 minutes, and thunderstorms may occur during either. During thunderstorms the world becomes darker, dark enough that enemy mobs may spawn, and lightning strikes setting fire to the block it hits. Snow fall will cover most blocks in snow and cause water to freeze and become blocks of ice.</p><h2>Blocks</h2><p>The following is a complete list of the blocks present in Minecraft as of version 1.2.5. They are listed by their data values as used in the game's code. Items marked with an asterisk cannot be obtained without the use of a memory editor. Certain blocks with identical functions are identified with the same code with an extra digit appended to indicate a different appearance.</p><table><thead><tr><th>ID</th><th>Block Name</th><th>Block Description</th><th>Appearance</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>0*</td><td>Air</td><td>Air is spontaneously generated in any area which is not currently holding a block. It has no effect on the player.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Stone</td><td>Stone is the most abundant block in Minecraft, making up the majority of its cave systems and rock formations. It cannot be obtained without the use of a pickaxe, and drops cobblestone when mined successfully.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Grass</td><td>Grows on top of dirt when enough light is present. Hoeing grass has a chance to produce grass seeds, which can be planted to grow wheat.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Dirt</td><td>Dirt covers most of the surface of the world in Minecraft. It has little use beyond being a makeshift building material, though it can be hoed to produce farmland (see block ID 60).</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Cobblestone</td><td>Produced automatically when stone is mined, or when lava runs over water. Its properties are otherwise identical to that of stone.</td></tr><tr><td>5-0</td><td>Oak Planks</td><td>All planks are crafted from logs of their respective wood type.

They can be killed for leather which is used to make the lowest level of armor in the game, and 2. With a bucket players can harvest milk from cows. Since the beta 1.8 Adventure update, cows will draw raw beef which can be cooked to make steak</p><p><b>Pigs</b></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/35470/1636110-minecraft_pig_knows_what_you_did_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1636110\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.87\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/35470/1636110-minecraft_pig_knows_what_you_did_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1636110\"><img alt=\"Squeal, Piggy!\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/35470/1636110-minecraft_pig_knows_what_you_did_2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/35470/1636110-minecraft_pig_knows_what_you_did_2.jpg 400w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/35470/1636110-minecraft_pig_knows_what_you_did_2.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Squeal, Piggy!</figcaption></figure><p>Pigs can be killed for pork chops which serve as the primary healing item in the game.

If a pig is struck by lightning during a thunderstorm then it will become a zombie pigman; a mob otherwise only found in the hell underworld of the Nether.</p><p><b>Chickens</b></p><p>Chickens can be killed for feathers; feathers are used to make arrows. If left alive, however, chickens can leave eggs on the ground. Since the beta 1.8 Adventure Update, chickens drop raw chicken when killed which can be cooked in a furnace.</p><p><b>Sheep</b></p><p>Originally sheep could be punched with any non-tool to shear them for 1-3 blocks of wool. After beta patch 1.7, however, punching sheep does not accomplish anything. And while sheep drop wool upon dying, it is only a single block. Sheep must now be sheared with actual shears which harvest 1-3 wool per sheep. As of update 1.1, sheep now eat grass to re-grow their wool.</p><p><b>Squid</b></p><p>Introduced with beta 1.2, these mobs spawn only in water with a slight chance of spawning in the shallows. While these animals are peaceful they can be killed to gain ink packets. These packets can be used to dye wool black.</p><p><b>Villagers</b></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8960/2136565-villagers.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2136565\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.9933333333333\" data-width=\"150\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 150px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:199.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8960/2136565-villagers.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2136565\"><img alt=\"A Villager\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" data-width=\"150\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8960/2136565-villagers.gif\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8960/2136565-villagers.gif 150w\"><noscript><img alt=\"A Villager\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8960/2136565-villagers.gif\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8960/2136565-villagers.gif 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" data-width=\"150\"></noscript></a><figcaption>A Villager</figcaption></figure><p>Villagers are the NPCs who spawn in procedurally-generated villages. Originally they were meant to have names, though every last one of them had \"Testificate\" in their name plate -- a nickname that has stuck with them since their inception. Clearly inhuman, the villagers never interact with the player and they are completely passive; not even fighting back if attacked by the player. Although most mobs ignore them completely, at night NPC villages come under attack from massive groups of zombies (as seen below) who will go to such lengths as breaking down wooden doors in order to get at the delicious villagers inside. To protect themselves, villagers construct Iron Golems, incredibly powerful constructs who will protect their masters to the death.</p><h3>Neutral Mobs</h3><p>These mobs will leave the player alone until provoked. The action causing provocation and the behavior of the mobs after they have been provoked differs between mobs.</p><p><b>Zombie Pigmen</b></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/64233/1676250-342px_zombiepigmsword.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1676250\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.7514619883041\" data-width=\"342\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 342px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:175.1%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/64233/1676250-342px_zombiepigmsword.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1676250\"><img alt=\"A Zombie Pigman\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 365px) 100vw, 365px\" data-width=\"365\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/64233/1676250-342px_zombiepigmsword.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/64233/1676250-342px_zombiepigmsword.png 342w\"><noscript><img alt=\"A Zombie Pigman\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/64233/1676250-342px_zombiepigmsword.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/64233/1676250-342px_zombiepigmsword.png 342w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 365px) 100vw, 365px\" data-width=\"365\"></noscript></a><figcaption>A Zombie Pigman</figcaption></figure><p>Only found in the Nether, or if a pig is hit by lightning, Zombie Pigmen are peaceful with the player and will not attack unless provoked. They passively wander around and make sounds crossed between pigs and zombies. They become hostile and make loud angry shrieks when attacked or damaged, at which point any other Zombie Pigmen in the area also become hostile. A single player is generally no match for a group of angry Zombie Pigmen. They wield Golden Swords and drop cooked pork chops upon death. Textures exist within the game for a non-zombie Pigman creature, but there is, as of yet, no way to encounter one.</p><p><b>Wolves</b></p><p>Introduced in Beta 1.4, wolves are the game's first tameable pet. They can be tamed by feeding them 5-6 bones. Once tamed, hearts will appear and a red collar is present on their neck. The player can tame more than one. The wolves will follow the player character and teleport to them if they get too far away. If the player right-clicks on them they will sit, and if the player feeds them pork chops they will regain health. Their health meter is represented by their tail (vertical tail is full health, lowered is low health). They will attack any players or mobs that the player character attacks, and defend them. Mobs will not attack them. In the wild they are neutral but will attack if provoked. They are somewhat rare but commonly found in forest-type areas.</p><p><b>Ocelots/Cats</b></p><p>Introduced in 1.2 of the full release, ocelots only spawn in the also-added jungle biomes, and while they will flee the player instead of engaging them if attacked, they will purposely hunt down and kill chickens. Like wolves, ocelots can be tamed, this time with the use of raw fish. However, unlike wolves, ocelots scare easily and will flee at high speeds (the only mob currently capable of sprinting) if the player moves or even <i>looks around</i> too suddenly near them. Once tamed ocelots inexplicably transform into house cats which come in three different varieties: tabby, siamese and tuxedo. Unlike tamed wolves, cats are not combat pets and will not defend their master if attacked by mobs (although they will still hunt chickens).</p><p><b>Enderman</b></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8960/1851496-enderman.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1851496\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"200\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 200px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8960/1851496-enderman.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1851496\"><img alt=\"An Enderman\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8960/1851496-enderman.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8960/1851496-enderman.png 200w\"><noscript><img alt=\"An Enderman\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8960/1851496-enderman.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8960/1851496-enderman.png 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\"></noscript></a><figcaption>An Enderman</figcaption></figure><p>The Endermen were added starting in Beta 1.8. Technically neutral, groups of endermen will slowly wander around picking up blocks and moving them around (making them the only mob capable of directly interacting with the world's blocks apart from creepers destroying them with their explosions). However, if the player looks <i>directly</i> at an individual enderman by placing their central reticule over one, it will stand motionless and stare back at them until they look away. At this point, the enderman has become hostile. Afterwards, the enderman will remain perfectly still while the player is looking at them, and run towards them extremely fast while their back is turned. In addition, endermen who are not being watched have the ability to teleport about once a second. Because of their similar appearance and names it is commonly thought that the endermen were inspired by \"Slender Man,\" a fictional cryptid invented on the Something Awful forums. Some have suggested that the Minecraft mob should have a more unique name, with \"Far Lander\" being suggested after the area towards the extreme edges of a Minecraft world, known as the Far Lands. Notch has made it clear that he will not be changing the enderman name, and that he would be more likely to change the Far Lands to \"the End\". This was later revealed as a sly reference to the secret home of the endermen; an alternate dimension called the End.</p><p><b>Iron Golems</b></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/56742/2149210-village_golem.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2149210\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.910447761194\" data-width=\"536\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 536px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:191.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/56742/2149210-village_golem.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2149210\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 335px) 100vw, 335px\" data-width=\"335\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/5/56742/2149210-village_golem.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/56742/2149210-village_golem.png 536w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/56742/2149210-village_golem.png 502w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/5/56742/2149210-village_golem.png 335w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/5/56742/2149210-village_golem.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/56742/2149210-village_golem.png 536w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/56742/2149210-village_golem.png 502w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/5/56742/2149210-village_golem.png 335w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 335px) 100vw, 335px\" data-width=\"335\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Introduced in 1.2 of the full release, Iron Golems are the automatons created by the villagers to protect them from the zombie hordes. Incredibly powerful, with more health than any other Minecraft mob save the Enderdragon, golems are completely harmless to the player unless deliberately provoked. On occasion, iron golems will approach villager children and present them with roses, a reference to a scene from the film <i>Castle in the Sky</i>. Although they will automatically engage zombies upon detecting them, iron golems will also do battle with any mob that damages a villager in it's vicinity. They will also protect the player in this manner, making them handy to have around. The player can also construct their own golems, should they wish. Though they still have the appearance of villagers.</p><h3>Hostile Mobs</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12951/1663447-150px_zombie__minecraft_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1663447\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.2933333333333\" data-width=\"150\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 150px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:129.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12951/1663447-150px_zombie__minecraft_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1663447\"><img alt=\"A Zombie\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" data-width=\"150\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12951/1663447-150px_zombie__minecraft_.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12951/1663447-150px_zombie__minecraft_.jpg 150w\"><noscript><img alt=\"A Zombie\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12951/1663447-150px_zombie__minecraft_.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12951/1663447-150px_zombie__minecraft_.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" data-width=\"150\"></noscript></a><figcaption>A Zombie</figcaption></figure><p>Each enemy type has its own special traits.

They have movement patterns almost identical to zombies, but Creepers make absolutely no noise unless within attack distance, at which point they will make a loud hissing noise (similar to an old-fashioned bomb's fuse being lit), promptly before swelling up and exploding. This leaves the player about a second to get out of the blast radius. The explosion is 75% the strength of TNT, and like TNT it destroys blocks around it and does less damage the further the player character is from the epicenter. Sometimes when a creeper is triggered and the player moves away quickly enough, the creeper will recede to its normal size and will not explode. Creepers drop gunpowder when killed by normal means but will not drop anything if they detonate. They also have a chance of dropping an LP record if they are killed by a skeleton's arrow. If a lightning bolt strikes a creeper or hits very near one, they will become electrified and supercharged. Their explosion is then 50% more powerful than TNT and will usually be a one hit kill.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/64233/1676246-slime1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1676246\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.77162629757785\" data-width=\"289\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 289px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:77.2%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/64233/1676246-slime1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1676246\"><img alt=\"Some Slimes\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 289px) 100vw, 289px\" data-width=\"289\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/64233/1676246-slime1.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/64233/1676246-slime1.png 289w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Some Slimes\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/64233/1676246-slime1.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/64233/1676246-slime1.png 289w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 289px) 100vw, 289px\" data-width=\"289\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Some Slimes</figcaption></figure><p><b>Slimes</b></p><p>Slimes are a very rare enemy that only spawn deep underground in special chunks of the world. Certain programs or mods can be used to find where they can spawn (mainly useful for creating a slime farm). As of now in the current Minecraft 1.8, slimes are limited to spawning between the layers of 0-16, but as of 1.9 pre-release this had been expanded to 0-40. Their attack is similar to a spider's as they simply jump towards the player, albeit not as ferociously. Slimes can spawn in various sizes, merging when they stay close enough to one another for long enough. The smallest slimes cannot do damage to the player. They also can only move around by jumping making plopping sounds as they land. They drop balls of green slime when killed which can be used (along with a piston) to create sticky pistons and both push and pull blocks. Slimes also spawn on peaceful difficulty (no enemies) but do no damage.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/64233/1676248-ghast.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1676248\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.3976608187135\" data-width=\"342\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 342px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:139.8%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/64233/1676248-ghast.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1676248\"><img alt=\"A Ghast\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 457px) 100vw, 457px\" data-width=\"457\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/64233/1676248-ghast.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/64233/1676248-ghast.png 342w\"><noscript><img alt=\"A Ghast\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/64233/1676248-ghast.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/64233/1676248-ghast.png 342w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 457px) 100vw, 457px\" data-width=\"457\"></noscript></a><figcaption>A Ghast</figcaption></figure><p><b>Ghasts</b></p><p>Mostly found in the Nether, Ghasts are huge, floating ghostly creatures that are characterized by their constant moaning when idle and blood-curdling screams when attacking. They launch explosive fireballs at the player that will destroy surrounding blocks, much like a creeper's explosion. It is possible to bounce the fireballs back at the ghast either by timing a hit on it with a sword or by shooting it with a bow and arrow. If a ghast manages to hit the player's portal to the real world with its fireball, the portal will close and will need re-igniting in order for the player to be able to leave. When ghasts are killed they drop gunpowder.</p><p>Notch has added a small chance that ghasts can spawn near active portals in the real world in the 1.5 update. However, this is not as terrible as it sounds given that the real world, unlike the Nether, has no ceiling, Ghasts in the real world will mainly just float off into the sky and harmlessly fly around the cloudline.</p><p><b>Spider Jockey</b></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/131021/1796831-200px_skelespider.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1796831\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.11\" data-width=\"200\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 200px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:111.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/131021/1796831-200px_skelespider.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1796831\"><img alt=\"The dreaded Spider Jockey\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/131021/1796831-200px_skelespider.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/131021/1796831-200px_skelespider.png 200w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The dreaded Spider Jockey\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/131021/1796831-200px_skelespider.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/131021/1796831-200px_skelespider.png 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The dreaded Spider Jockey</figcaption></figure><p>Spider jockeys, a spider being ridden by a skeleton, are very rare to see. Every time a spider spawns there is a 1% chance it will spawn with a skeleton on its back making it a Spider Jockey. The creature retains the ability of a spider to climb up walls and the skeleton's ability to fire arrows making it a formidable enemy. The game still treats the mob as two separate entities, though, with the spider and the skeleton having separate health and when one is killed the other will remain. The movement of the spider jockey is decided by the spider.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/15/150889/2281097-blaze.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2281097\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"200\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 200px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/15/150889/2281097-blaze.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2281097\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/15/150889/2281097-blaze.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/15/150889/2281097-blaze.png 200w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/15/150889/2281097-blaze.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/15/150889/2281097-blaze.png 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Blaze</p><p>Blazes are mobs found in the Nether.

Draglade, Draglade 2 is a 2D rhythm fighting game.", "description": "<h2>Gameplay<br /></h2>Draglade 2's gameplay is very similar to <a href=\"/\">  Draglade</a>'s.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <br /><br /><h3>Fighting<br /></h3>\"Grappers\" are combatants who use \"Glades\", weapons that make distinct musical sounds when they hit something.\u00a0 Glades take on various forms of weapons: swords, hammers, spears, axes, etc. <br />\u00a0<br />Combat moves are effectuated via the DS buttons for light or strong attacks.\u00a0 Various combos can be effectuated by connecting these two forms of attack together.\u00a0 Custom combos can also be made and associated with your glade through a music creation menu.\u00a0 These combos have different effects based on the rhythm that you set for the related music and, when activated in combat, there is a simple rhythm game that activates.\u00a0 The simpler the created rhythm, the weaker the combo.\u00a0 Players can also purchase set rhythms for use.<br />\u00a0<br />Grappers also hold \"Bullets\".\u00a0 These Bullets are special attacks that are used for offense and defense and come in many forms: fireballs, healing devices and energy beams, to name a few.\u00a0 These Bullets are activated via taps on the touch screen, in combat.\u00a0 When a Bullet is activated, it will consume energy out of a bar, limiting its usage. <br />\u00a0 <br /><h3>Story mode<br /></h3>There are several selectable characters initially, all with their own storylines.\u00a0 The story is delivered through in-game cutscenes and dialogue.\u00a0 To progress, the player is required to travel to stadiums and defeat the opponents that are present there or speak to NPCs relevant to the plot.\u00a0\u00a0 <br />\u00a0<br />In-between cities, the player encounters monsters named \"variants\".\u00a0 These act like human opponents and, when defeated, can offer rewards such as loot and experience points.\u00a0 There are also minor platforming aspects in these environments. <br />\u00a0<br /><h3>Multiplayer<br /></h3>The game supports Wi-Fi with player-to-player matchmaking.\u00a0 Draglade 2 also enables players to play locally with a friend with another Nintendo DS, even if the friend in question does not own the game Draglade 2. <br />\u00a0<br /><h2>Story<br /></h2>Grappers are fighters who use Glades and Bullets to battle other Grappers in arenas.\u00a0 They go from town to town, succeeding in tournaments to achieve their ultimate goal: to become the Major Grapper. <br />\u00a0 <br /><h3>Characters<br /></h3>Most of the characters are typical anime archetypes (overconfident and brash main protagonist who wears headphones).\u00a0 The story also simlarly follows that line, with an evil organization trying to impede the Grappers and achieve domination.\u00a0 Returning characters from the previous game are: <br />\u00a0<br /><h3><u>Hibito </u></h3><b>Element: </b>Fire <br /><b>Glade type: </b>Sword <br />\u00a0<br />A confident and ambitious Grapper who has wished to be the best Grapper ever since he was saved by one from a variant when he was younger.\u00a0 He travels about to become the Major Grapper. <br />\u00a0<br /><h3><u>Guy<br /></u></h3><b>Element: </b>Lightning <br /><b>Glade type: </b>Fist or gauntlet <br />\u00a0<br />Guy used to be part of an evil Grapper gang by the name of \"Black Fang\".\u00a0 He was known as the \"Shadow Fist\" during that time and used the power of the \"Dark Glades\", but he eventually abandoned his evil ways.\u00a0 His objective is to become powerful enough to defeat the Black

Even dragons.</figcaption></figure><p>The game's story follows <a href=\"/kirby/3005-726/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-726\"> Kirby</a>, who after eating a metameto belonging to the evil wizard Yin-Yarn, is sucked into a magic sock and transported to a world where everything is made of yarn, textiles, and buttons. Kirby himself is transformed into a being made of yarn, and as a result has also lost the ability to inhale his enemies to absorb their powers.</p><p>Upon arriving in this strange new world, Kirby encounters Prince Fluff, joining forces with him to defeat Yin-Yarn. Kirby also discovers that the metameto has given himself the power to transform into new shapes, such as a car, parachute and submarine.</p><h2>Graphics</h2><p>The star of Kirby's Epic Yarn is arguably the aesthetic style of the graphics. Everything in the game, from Kirby to his enemies to the environment, all appear as though they're constructed out of yarn, cloth, and buttons. Kirby is able to interact with this cloth world by ducking between fabric layers to reach platforms that rest between them, pull pieces of cloth away from the landscape to reveal items, and even unzip sections of the levels to reveal passageways. The cohesive look and feel to the design gives Kirby's Epic Yarn an infectiously cute appearance from start to finish.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Though Kirby can't vacuum up his enemies in the traditional manner of his earlier games, he has an entirely new set of skills in the patchwork world to help him navigate obstacles and defeat his foes. He can change the shape of his yarn body into items like a parachute, car, and submarine, and at certain points can take the form of a giant, rocket-spewing tank or a flying saucer.</p><p>Two players can play through Kirby's Epic Yarn cooperatively, with the second player taking control of Prince Fluff.</p><h3>Difficulty</h3><p>Kirby's Epic Yarn is not designed to be a difficult game to complete. It is impossible for Kirby and Prince Fluff to die. The real challenge of the game is to uncover all of the secrets and complete each stage with as many gems as possible. Even a single hit from an enemy will cause Kirby to lose a large chunk of gems.</p><p>There is an overworld in the game to tie all the levels together. Nintendo has called this overworld \"Kirby's Pad\" and the player is able to decorate it with items they collect in the adventure.</p><h2>Abilities</h2><p>In this game, Kirby has a whole new set of abilities to help him throughout his adventure.</p><h3>Car</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1405575-tr_kirbyepicyarn_061510_1500_053.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1405575\" data-size=\"medium\" style=\"width: 640px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1405575-tr_kirbyepicyarn_061510_1500_053.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1405575\"><img alt=\"Beep beep.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1405575-tr_kirbyepicyarn_061510_1500_053.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1405575-tr_kirbyepicyarn_061510_1500_053.jpg 640w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1405575-tr_kirbyepicyarn_061510_1500_053.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>Beep beep.</figcaption></figure><p>If you double-tap in either direction, instead of dashing, you turn into a <a href=\"/car/3055-322/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-322\"> car</a> and honk in the first few seconds.</p><h3>Parachute</h3><p>After a jump you may hold the button to turn into a <a href=\"/parachute/3055-504/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-504\"> parachute</a>.

One move uses the arms to beat enemies directly in front of the tank, and they may also fire <a href=\"/missile/3055-74/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-74\"> missiles</a> to defeat airborne enemies.</p><h3>Stone</h3><p>While in the air, if you press down on the D-Pad you turn into a variation on Kirby's <a href=\"/stone/3055-854/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-854\"> stone</a> ability to smash enemies or blocks to get to new areas.</p><h3>Submarine</h3><p>When Kirby goes underwater, he changes form into what seems to be a <a href=\"/submarine/3055-828/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-828\"> submarine</a>.

The main feature of this transformation is Kirby's ability to spray the hose of the fire engine.</p><h3>Train</h3><p>Kirby will take the form of a train, and the player manipulates train tracks to guide him through a level.</p><h3>String</h3><p>Pressing the 1 button on the Wii Remote allows you to throw a piece of yarn like a <a href=\"/lasso/3055-2027/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2027\"> lasso</a> towards an enemy, object, or a piece of the background. You may be able to hold the object or enemy over your head and throw it at an enemy. This ability seems to replace Kirby's ability to inhale and subsequently spit out an enemy.</p><p> </p><h2>Development</h2><p>The game began development under the name \"Keito no Fluff\" (lit. \"Fluff of Yarn\") and featured <a href=\"/prince-fluff/3005-17469/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-17469\">Prince Fluff</a> as the main character. During the summer of 2009 however, Nintendo proposed that the game be altered and released as a title in the <a href=\"/kirby/3025-420/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-420\">Kirby </a>series.</p><p>The game's soundtrack was scored entirely by Good-Feel's Tomoya Tomita, as franchise regulars Hirokazu Ando and Jun Ishikawa were busy at the time composing the music to <a

This time, they're planning to deploy deadly weapons underwater.", "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Deep Black is a third-person shooter developed by <a href=\"/biart-studio/3010-6432/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6432\">Biart Studio</a>. The game takes place almost entirely in underwater environments, featuring realistic physics and cover-based shooter gameplay. The game is <a href=\"/directx/3015-5193/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5193\">DirectX 10</a> compatible and uses an in house engine.</p><h2>Story</h2><p>The plot of the game is set in a not so distant future, where bio terrorists plan to deploy a deadly bio virus through the world's water supply. You play as Pierce, a Special Ops soldier equipped with a high tech government suit that gives you the ability to freely roam underwater environments. He's the only hope to stop the terrorists deadly plans.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Deep Black takes place mainly underwater. You control Pierce the same way that you would control <a href=\"/isaac-clarke/3005-1197/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1197\">Isaac</a> during the zero gravity portions of <a href=\"/dead-space/3025-1229/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1229\">Dead Space</a>. Pierce can rotate 360 degrees in all directions and never runs out of breath thanks to his suit. To make underwater navigation easier, Pierce is equipped with a jet pack that propels him to where he needs to go.</p><p>The player has access to high tech equipment such as the harpoon. The harpoon is important for taking out enemies and solving puzzles (most of which consist in raising water levels or opening doors). The harpoon can be used to hack panels that are out of reach. It can also be used to hack some of the smaller mech enemies, turning them against their allies. If you are faced with a human enemy or a bigger mech, the harpoon will drag them over to you, at which point you must complete a quick time event to melee kill your opponent (usually with the blade that sticks out of Pierce's arm).</p><p>Weapons are an integral part of Deep Black. You have an assault rifle, a pistol and a shotgun. All these weapons can be used underwater, the game providing an over the shoulder zoom when aiming. There are also sequences in the game where you will be fighting on land. For these sequences, the game lets you take cover behind objects as well as perform stealth takedowns.</p><h2>Development</h2><p>Deep Black was originally called Underwater Wars until a renaming of the game was announced. The game was supposedly going to be released in the first quarter of 2011, however it had been pushed back. It was released in Germany in May 2011, but only in the German language. A worldwide release is due February 2012.</p><h2>System Requirements</h2><ul><li><strong>OS: </strong>Windows XP, Vista or Windows 7</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Core 2 Duo 2.4 GHz or Althon X2 2.7 GHz</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 1GB</li><li><strong>Hard Disk Space:</strong> 6 GB free hard drive space</li><li><strong>Video Card:</strong> DirectX 9, 10 or 11 compatible NVidia or AMD ATI card.

The objective is to knockout each character to win a total sum of $50,000 ($10k each) and, if given, the character's buy-in; which can then be used in Team Fortress 2 if won. If a player loses, they have the option to continue watching the game being played by the AI. A player's total winnings has no inherent use, though it does cause a player's 'poker name' to change. Additionally, the game offers a tutorial and a list of winning hands for those new to the game.</p><p>The game uses Telltale's dynamic dialogue system to create a lively and colorful round of poker. Characters make <a href=\"/self-referential-humor/3015-2056/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2056\">references to their respective franchises</a> and converse with each other; as well as comment on the player's actions (or lack of).

Afterwords, the license holders/creators were contacted. All loving the idea, Telltale found themselves with the challenge of \u201cnot [ruining] four other people's very personal creations\u201d. The developers worked very closely with the creators to make sure the characters were true to the source material. The game had a very small development team; at one point peaking seven in total. Jokingly, the developers stated that there were more lawyers involved than the those working on the actual project.</p><p>The script, written by Telltale\u2019s <a href=\"/sean-vanaman/3040-92998/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-92998\">Sean Vanaman</a>, is based on the character\u2019s established personalities. Each creator was key to making sure the dialogue for each character, as well as the in-between conversations and relationships, were not only authentic but didn\u2019t sound forced. Homestar Runner co-creator Matt Chapman, who voices Strong Bad, would not only read his lines but also drastically rephrase them during recording; which was also something he did for <a href=\"/strong-bads-cool-game-for-attractive-people/3030-27084/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-27084\">Strong Bad\u2019s Cool Game for Attractive People</a>.

Another enthusiast, I presume?\"<br />-Reginald Van Winslow</p></blockquote> Reginald Van Winslow, from the <i>Tales of Monkey Island</i> franchise, is the former captain of the Screaming Narwhal. Later, he joins <a href=\"/\">Guybrush</a> <a href=\"/\">Threepwood's</a> crew, which he remained a loyal first mate.<br />Reginald works as a host for The Inventory, including the actual poker game: narrating the wins &amp; loses of the characters and increasing the blinds after each round. Despite some claims, he is not the dealer. Additionally, while he doesn't own the place, he is knowledgeable of the club's history- which he is more than willing to educate the player on. Reginald is the only character, including smaller cameos, who appears almost completely different from his original design. Here, he is seen in a beret and a dinner jacket.</li></ul><h3>The Poker Players</h3><p><b><a href=\"/max/3005-893/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-893\">Max</a></b> Voiced by: William Casten</p><p>One of the main characters from Sam and Max, Telltale's flagship adventure game franchise based on the comic book series by <a href=\"/steve-purcell/3040-2866/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-2866\">Steve Purcell</a>, who returns to write most of his dialogue. He is one half of the the game's Freelance Police duo and acts as a foil to his partner, <a href=\"/sam/3005-868/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-868\">Sam</a>. He's trigger-happy, sociopathic, and even has psychic abilities (which he may, or may not, be using during the tournament).</p><p>In Poker Night, he seems to have a limited knowledge of Texas Hold 'Em; often asking the most basic of rules (\"What do those numbers on the cards mean?\"). Speculatively, he may have joined the tournament on an whim; a decision not out of his character. When chatting, he talks about his life as a freelance police officer and makes references to his past adventures. Additionally, when asked about his video game career, he switches off and on between being unaware that he is a video game character to breaking the fourth wall.</p><p>Max gets along well with everyone on the table, including the player, with even the Heavy considering him as a friend. When busted out, Max takes it pretty well; leaving with a smile as he goes off to wander around in the background.</p><p>When he doesn't have the cash, Max buys in with the License to Maim badge and the Lugermorph pistol.</p><p><b><a href=\"/strong-bad/3005-1994/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1994\">Strong Bad</a></b> Voiced by: Matt Chapman</p><p>Arguably, the most popular character from the <a href=\"/homestar-runner/3025-925/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-925\">Homestar Runner</a> flash animations. The resident bully of <a href=\"/free-country-usa/3035-429/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-429\">Free Country, USA</a>, and the leader of the vacant lot/country of Strong Badia. He spends his time hatching schemes, playing video games, reading e-mails, giving his co-stars a hard time, and being 'awesome'. His dialogue is also co-written by The Brothers Chaps, with Matt reprising his role.</p><p>Strong Bad appears in his usual egotistic form; bragging about his \"luck\" with women, his laughably outdated technology, and his poker abilities. He is most aware of his video game career, as well as his Internet fame. Also, he is more than willing to talk smack about Telltale Games: holding a grudge after the real life sub-par sales of <a href=\"/strong-bads-cool-game-for-attractive-people/3030-27084/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-27084\">Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People</a>.</p><p>Strong Bad absolutely hates Tycho, (with the feeling being mutual) referring him to a lifeless \"dork\" numerous times and claiming to be superior to him in all ways. (e.g: website hits, technology, ladies) Conversely, he gets along fairly well with the Heavy: being seen in his eyes as a \"Tiny Heavy\".</p><p>Strong Bad buys in with the Dangeresque, Too? shades when he doesn't have the cash.</p><p><b><a href=\"/heavy/3005-484/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-484\">Heavy Weapons Guy</a></b> Voiced by: Gary Schwartz</p><p>The Heavy Weapons Guy is the chief defensive class of Team Fortress 2, Valve Software's popular multiplayer/FPS franchise. He is the unofficial mascot of the game's <a href=\"/team-fortress-2/3030-18162/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18162\">impossibly popular sequel</a>, which his appearance is based on. Hailing from Russia, he has used his strength and knowledge in Heavy Weapons to become an irreplaceable asset to the RED Team.</p><p>The Heavy's motives for being in the tournament are unclear, but nonetheless he enjoys the game and talking about his many battles. He even delves into his school years and hobbies; though it should be noted that these stories and comments have been declared non-canon to the <i>Team Fortress 2</i> universe, since the dialogue was mostly written by Telltale. He is also totally unaware that he is a video game character. When asked about the game and some of its gameplay, the Heavy is visibly confused or describes them as being dreams or lucky occurrences. He claims the RED Medic, Demoman, and Engineer are his friends, while the BLU Spy is the cause of every bad hand.</p><p>While he gets along fine with the other players, The Heavy doesn't trust Tycho, seeing him as a threat since he wears a <a href=\"/red-vs-blue/3015-5165/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5165\">blue</a> sweatshirt.</p><p>The Iron Curtain minigun is bought in by the Heavy in when he doesn't have the cash.</p><p><b><a href=\"/tycho-brahe/3005-671/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-671\">Tycho Brahe</a></b> Voiced by: Andrew Chaikin</p><p>Tycho Brahe is video and tabletop game enthusiast from the <a href=\"/penny-arcade/3025-1015/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1015\">Penny Arcade</a> webcomic. He is the foil to comic co-star Johnathan Gabriel and is also the alter-ego of the comic's co-creator <a href=\"/jerry-holkins/3040-89527/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-89527\">Jerry Holkins</a>. While Jerry himself doesn't voice the character, he worked with the writers to keep the character authentic.</p><p>While Tycho is the most well-spoken of the group he is also the crudest. His dialogue is laced with strong language, which can be <a href=\"/optional-censorship/3015-5122/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5122\">censored</a>, and at times he makes comments of a sexual nature. In some cases he delves into his fetishes (namely, bestiality, which is also an on-going joke in the comic), much to the shock and disgust of the other players. Despite this, he is very knowledgeable in not only gaming but also in literature, computers, history, and English. At times, he decides to fold or call by rolling a 20-sided die. Some of his dialogue hints that he is in the tournament in order to pay off some shady people.</p><p>Tycho appears to be the only one who knows where each character really came from, which leads to some awkward or eye-brow raising conversations (e.g., wincing awkwardly when Heavy claims he's immortal, rather than dying and respawning). He gets the most well with Max; sometimes even exchanging zombie survival tactics.</p><p>When strapped for cash, Tycho buys in with the Enthusiast's Timepiece watch.</p><h2>Music</h2><p>The soundtrack for the game, while not officially released, contains blues-style covers of songs from each character's universe-- except Tycho's. These can be accessed via the game's files, ripped using the Telltale Music Extractor.</p><h3>Sam and Max</h3><ul><li>The Office</li><li><a href=\"/general-skun-kape/3005-14319/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-14319\">General Skun-ka'pe</a></li></ul><h3>Team Fortress 2</h3><ul><li>Team Fortress 2 Theme</li><li>\"More Gun\"</li></ul><h3>Homestar Runner</h3><ul><li>Theme from \"Dangeresque\"</li><li>\"Trogdor\" (It's worth noting that this isn't the actual Trogdor theme, although it does borrow from it a little.)</li></ul><h2>Tables</h2><p>New table designs are unlocked as the player wins tournaments.</p><table><tbody><tr><th>Table</th><th>Unlocked with win #</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td><b>The Inventory</b><br />(default table)</td><td>00</td><td>A simple traditional green design with the locations of cards marked on its surface</td></tr><tr><td><b>Max Imp</b></td><td>01</td><td>A red table with a picture of Max Imp</td></tr><tr><td><b>Trogdor</b></td><td>02</td><td>A green design with a <a href=\"/trogdor/3005-8673/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-8673\">Trogdor the Burninator</a> pattern at the center</td></tr><tr><td><b>Telltale Games</b></td><td>04</td><td>A green table with the Telltale Games logo in the center</td></tr><tr><td><b>Automata</b></td><td>05</td><td>A black table with the picture of Carl from the Penny Arcade miniseries Automata in the center<br /><ul><li>This table gives the entire place a monochromatic coloring</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><b>RED Team</b></td><td>07</td><td>A red and white table with Team Fortress' RED team logo in the center<br /><ul><li>This table causes the Heavy to wear the <i>Dealer's Visor</i></li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><b>Fruit \"Friend\"</b></td><td>08</td><td>A dark blue table with a picture of a <a href=\"/fruit-fucker-mark-i/3015-556/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-556\">Fruit Fucker</a> in the middle with oranges surrounding it</td></tr><tr><td><b>Videlectrix</b></td><td>10</td><td>A red and orange table with yellow circles around the Videlectrix logo in the center; their slogan just below<br /><ul><li>This table causes Strong Bad's model to changes to retro-style polygons</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><b>BLU Team</b></td><td>11</td><td>A blue and white table with Team Fortress' BLU team logo in the center</td></tr><tr><td><b>Strongbadia</b></td><td>13</td><td>A table with the <a href=\"/strong-bads-cool-game-for-attractive-people-episode-2-strong-badia-the-free/3030-23066/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-23066\">Strongbadian</a> flag displayed on its surface</td></tr><tr><td><b>Team Fortress 2</b></td><td>14</td><td>A dirty orange table with the Team Fortress logo in the center</td></tr><tr><td><b>Twisp &amp; Catsby</b></td><td>16</td><td>A dark blue table featuring Twisp on the right, Catsby on the left, and the moon at the very centre</td></tr><tr><td><b>Max &amp; Crossbones</b></td><td>17</td><td>A green table with Max's <i>skull and crossbones</i> in the center<br /><ul><li>This table changes Max into a skeleton!!</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><b>Freelance Police</b></td><td>19</td><td>A blue table with the <a href=\"/sam-max-freelance-police/3030-25575/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-25575\">Freelance Police</a> emblem in the center</td></tr><tr><td><b>Telltale Games Shield</b></td><td>20</td><td>A black table featuring a shield in the center, representing the four characters in the game; the Telltale Games logo lies at the center of the shield<br /><ul><li>This table combines all the effects present in the Automata, RED Team, Videlectrix and Max &amp; Crossbones tables</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Decks</h2><p>A new design of cards is unlocked at every three tournaments won.</p><table><tbody><tr><th>Deck of Cards</th><th>Unlocked with win #</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td><b>The Inventory</b> (default deck)</td><td>00</td><td>A traditional deck of cards, designed to appear old</td></tr><tr><td><b>Team Fortress 2</b></td><td>03</td><td><p>The black cards are colored blue and the Ace and the Royal cards have the following replacements:</p><ul><li><b>Ace</b> -- Spade has <a href=\"/saxton-hale/3005-13386/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-13386\">Saxton Hale</a></li></ul><ul><li><b>King</b> -- The Heavy (Red); <a href=\"/soldier/3005-480/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-480\">Soldier</a> (Blue)</li><li><b>Queen</b> -- The Models from the ingame calendars</li><li><b>Jack</b> -- <a href=\"/scout/3005-365/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-365\">Scout</a> (Blue); <a href=\"/demoman/3005-483/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-483\">Demoman</a> (Red)</li></ul><br /><ul><li><b>Back of Cards</b>: Team Fortress 2 logo with blue and red corners</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><b>Homestar Runner</b></td><td>06</td><td><p>The cards are in 8-bit style; numbered cards simply feature the suit in the center with the card's corresponding number on top of it.

The game bears a unique visual style and \"Out of this World\"-style platforming gameplay.", "description": "<h2>Overview &amp; Gameplay</h2><p>In some respects, Outland wears its influences on its sleeve. Described by developers as a cross between seminal shooter <a href=\"/ikaruga/3030-12069/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-12069\">Ikaruga</a> and classic platformer <a href=\"/out-of-this-world/3030-17483/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-17483\">Out of this World</a>, Outland forces players to constantly juggle the polarity of their character while they engage in combat platforming. The <a href=\"/polarity/3015-680/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-680\">polarity</a> mechanic is almost identical to that in <a href=\"/ikaruga/3030-12069/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-12069\">Ikaruga</a>; as the player traverses through the game, they must change the polarity of their character to match bullets and to oppose enemies.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19513/1500339-outland_8.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1500339\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"800\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19513/1500339-outland_8.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1500339\"><img alt=\"Outland features a unique visual style and an Ikaruga-like Polarity mechanic.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/19513/1500339-outland_8.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19513/1500339-outland_8.jpg 800w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/19513/1500339-outland_8.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/19513/1500339-outland_8.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Outland features a unique visual style and an Ikaruga-like Polarity mechanic.</figcaption></figure><p>This is where Outland's fiendish difficulty lies. While avoiding bullets of the opposite color, the player must fight various enemies, most of which have polarity themselves. In order to deal damage, the player must change their polarity to oppose that of the enemy - if the polarities match, the enemy can still deal damage but the player's attacks are rendered useless. This polarity mechanic persists into platforming puzzles. Certain platforms remain stationary unless the player is the correct polarity, others simply disappear, and ornate patterns of light won't illuminate unless they are of the correct alignment. The staggered introduction of these different mechanics makes for a gradual learning curve, and a punishing final world.</p><p>The game's combat, similar to <a href=\"/prince-of-persia/3025-431/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-431\">Prince of Persia</a>, involves simple but effective swordplay, with a basic three hit combo at its core. Over the course of the game, the player will face a variety of foes ranging from spiders to soldiers, flowers to jellyfish, and armadillos to dragons. Each enemy has larger, more complex variations, like the shielded, mace-wielding, soldier. As stated, the polarity mechanic persists into combat, and damage can only be dealt to enemies of opposing polarity. This fails to prove much of a challenge in the early game, but Outland employs a timing mechanic in later stages that constantly changes the polarity of enemies, forcing the player to repeatedly change polarity to deal damage.</p><p>This visually outstanding game employs a silhouette art-style, superimposed on artistically striking backgrounds. The game's aesthetic draws heavily from ancient civilizations, most notably Mayan and Aztec, an influence seen predominantly in enemy design and structural architecture.</p><p>Throughout the game, various temples grant the player with various navigational and combat abilities. There are similar, harder to find, temples used to increase health and energy capacities. These abilities ease the flow of combat, and, drawing heavily from the Metroid framework, allow the player to access areas that were previously inaccessible. Learnt combat abilities consume energy, energy which is gained from slaying enemies.</p><p><b>Abilities:</b></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19513/1500341-outland_10.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1500341\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"800\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19513/1500341-outland_10.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1500341\"><img alt=\"A temple at which abilities are acquired\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/19513/1500341-outland_10.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19513/1500341-outland_10.jpg 800w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/19513/1500341-outland_10.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/19513/1500341-outland_10.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>A temple at which abilities are acquired</figcaption></figure><ul><li>Slide: A simple slide which allows traversal through small holes and deals damage to enemies.</li><li>Pound: A forceful smash into the ground which breaks rubble and does damage to enemies</li><li>Boost: The protagonist charges his power and breaks rubble blocking his way.</li><li>Launch Pads: These magical spheres allow the player to be propelled by godlike forces.</li><li>Energy Beam: A large beam which does a large amount of damage to any enemy it hits</li><li>Force Push: The player absorbs any bullets around him and uses the energy to send a large wave damaging all enemies on the screen.</li><li>Smite: A powerful sword swing that will decimate enemies in a single blow.</li></ul><h2>Co-op</h2><p>Outland's campaign can be played cooperatively with another player and there are also five challenge rooms that can only be played in co-op.

Two godly sisters, respectively representing light and darkness (or blue and red), have come together to form the world, and over the course of many thousands of years, now aim to destroy it. The silent protagonist finds himself on his sickly deathbed and travels the world looking for a way to be healed.</p><p>He finds himself collapsed at the feet of an old shaman who relays the story of the sisters and tells him that only a hero looking to save the world from destruction can allow the man to be reborn anew.After a flashback where the protagonist is catapulted into the shoes of the last hero, fighting the same gods 30,000 years ago, he sets off on his journey to again defeat the godly sisters. The player is given more and more clues into the motives of the goddesses and their minions as they progress through the story mode, each nugget being presented post boss fight or learned ability. Along the way, the player will travel to five worlds: Jungle, Underworld, City, Sky, and the final level. Each level is then divided into various stages as the main character adventures on through them. Finalizing at a final confrontation with the Twin Sisters.</p><h3>Bosses</h3><p>The bosses in Outland require the player to mix various abilities in order to defeat them at the end of each level. There are a total of five bosses through out the game, each with a significant role within the world Outland inhabits. Below, are the in-game descriptions which followed a dichotomous structure. The game would first reveal what the bosses old, glorious role and follow it with the method of their fall.</p><p><b>The Golem</b></p><p>The player finds the golem at the end of the Jungle level, where he stands watch in a half-eroded state with his mighty hammer. The elder guiding the protagonist then reveals the following about the Golem:</p><blockquote><p>Carved from the bones of the earth, the Golem was the protector of the land. The gods themselves set him to stand guard on the Temple of Eternity. But his heart betrayed him. For love of the prisoners of time, he foreswore his sacred duty. Now he crumbles into rubble and dust.</p></blockquote><p><b>The High Priestess</b></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/22435/1783114-screenshot_05.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1783114\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/22435/1783114-screenshot_05.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1783114\"><img alt=\"The High Priestess.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/22435/1783114-screenshot_05.png\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/22435/1783114-screenshot_05.png 1280w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/2/22435/1783114-screenshot_05.png 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/22435/1783114-screenshot_05.png 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/22435/1783114-screenshot_05.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The High Priestess.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/22435/1783114-screenshot_05.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/22435/1783114-screenshot_05.png 1280w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/2/22435/1783114-screenshot_05.png 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/22435/1783114-screenshot_05.png 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/22435/1783114-screenshot_05.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The High Priestess.</figcaption></figure><p>The High Priestess resides in her temple at the end of the Underworld and uses illusions in attempt to foil the player. The elder reveals the following about the priestess:</p><blockquote><p>Once the High Priestess lead the gods in their holy rites. She knew the secrets of the heavens and the earth, blessing their creation, and she studied the Cycle of the Ages. Alas, she learned too much, and sought to join in the unmaking of all things. Who will sing the sacred songs, now that the High Priestess is gone?</p></blockquote><p><b>The Mother of Eyes</b></p><p>The Mother of Eyes inhabits the deep under layers of the city. This behemoth resembles the various spiderlings the player has struggled against throughout the game, implying that the Mother of Eyes is the source of these enemies. The player fights through her layer, facing her, and her brood. After her defeat, the elder states this about the boss:</p><blockquote><p>The Mother of Eyes knew the order that underlies the world, for She wove it out of nothingness. With Sister Moon, and Sister Sun, she established the very rhythms of existence. Perhaps she envied the sisters, who chose their own path. Following them, She abandoned all her labors save those of death. Now it has claimer Her, too.</p></blockquote><p><b>The Winged Serpent</b></p><p>The Winged Serpent, boss of the Sky level, resembles a large serpentine dragon, and the fight takes place in both the earth and the sky. As with the Mother of Eyes, the Serpent resembles another enemy found beforehand, however, the connection between the two is not as clear.</p><p><b>The Twin Sisters</b></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/20255/1777621-big_bosses_outland_img1.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1777621\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/20255/1777621-big_bosses_outland_img1.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1777621\"><img alt=\"The Twin Sisters\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/20255/1777621-big_bosses_outland_img1.jpeg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/20255/1777621-big_bosses_outland_img1.jpeg 640w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/20255/1777621-big_bosses_outland_img1.jpeg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/20255/1777621-big_bosses_outland_img1.jpeg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Twin Sisters\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/20255/1777621-big_bosses_outland_img1.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/20255/1777621-big_bosses_outland_img1.jpeg 640w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/20255/1777621-big_bosses_outland_img1.jpeg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/20255/1777621-big_bosses_outland_img1.jpeg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Twin Sisters</figcaption></figure><p>The Twin Sisters are the gods who helped create the very universe in which the player inhabits.

The game went through a closed and open beta period in the early months of 2012, and released in Japan for the PC on July 4, 2012. The mobile version of the game is currently slated for a Q4 2012 release and the PS Vita version is being targeted for Japanese release in early 2013. All versions of the game will run on the same servers, allowing players to use the same characters cross-platform, though the versions set to appear on mobile phone platforms are said to be reduced versions of the game. On July 9th, 2012, SEGA announced plans to localize the game for North American and European territories. An English PC version was slated for an early 2013 release, yet as of late March 2013, Sonic Team officially delayed the release in North America. Never with a true release date, the team continues to bypass any specifics as to when the title will make its way overseas.</p><p>In addition to a new story, new areas, quests, and characters, PSO2 brings a host of gameplay changes.

Micro-transactions are applied to a variety of functions in the game such as new character slots or purchasing stat resets. These micro-transactions take place using a currency called Arks Cash, which can be purchased using real-world money. Arks Cash can also be spent on access to the \"Premium Set,\" which grants access to a private room (which can be decorated), the ability to trade items, access to sell items via a searchable player-run shop system, and lobbies specifically built for use by premium members.</p><p>The game's successful open beta and launch, as well as excitement for a new game in the <a href=\"/phantasy-star/3025-454/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-454\">Phantasy Star</a> series, has attracted a strong English community in the Japanese version, which attempts to congregate on Ship 02 and, more recently, Ship 10. The sudden influx of new players, a large majority being international, had forced SEGA to temporarily close down character registration on the most popular Ships from July 8th to the 18th. Character registration is now re-open on all Ships.</p><h2>Classes</h2><p>There are three classes to play as in PSO2: Hunter, Ranger, and Force. Players pick a class to start as but can switch to any other class at any time. Each class starts at level 1 and levels independently. When a player switches from one class to another, the previous class' progress is maintained and can be returned to at any time. The three classes have unique weapons, though all three can use the Gunslash, a melee/ranged weapon that swaps from one mode to the other on command.</p><h3>Hunter</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8124/2259911-pso20120708_170353_021.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2259911\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.4439461883408\" data-width=\"223\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 223px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:144.4%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8124/2259911-pso20120708_170353_021.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2259911\"><img alt=\"Xeno, a Hunter AI partner.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 223px) 100vw, 223px\" data-width=\"223\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8124/2259911-pso20120708_170353_021.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8124/2259911-pso20120708_170353_021.jpg 223w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Xeno, a Hunter AI partner.\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8124/2259911-pso20120708_170353_021.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8124/2259911-pso20120708_170353_021.jpg 223w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 223px) 100vw, 223px\" data-width=\"223\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Xeno, a Hunter AI partner.</figcaption></figure><p>The Hunter class is the melee class, and they focus on up-close damage with swords and photon arts.

Players are ranked when completing a quest, with the rank being dependent on the number of enemies defeated and the goal completion. The highest rank is the almighty <a href=\"/s-rank/3015-2962/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2962\">S-rank</a>.</p><h3>Quest Counter</h3><p>Quest Counter quests can be accepted at the, quest counter. This is located on the top floor of the ship.</p><h4><a href=\"http://i.minus.com/i3x6pIk15wP5i.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">Free Exploration</a></h4><p>Free Exploration quests are unlocked through Koffee's client orders. These quests are only available after completing all of the Arks quests, and do not contain any in-area objectives. The goal is instead an <i>Emergency Code: Duel</i>, where players must defeat a boss in the third area. These bosses are significantly more difficult than regular or <a href=\"/mini-boss/3015-420/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-420\">elite</a> enemies and require a bigger time investment to defeat. While Free Exploration quests do not contain objectives within the first two areas, it is possible for one or more <i>Emergency Code</i> mini-quests to appear whilst exploring.</p><h4><a href=\"http://i.minus.com/ibfMwzEerrKgNt.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">Arks Quests</a></h4><p>These are the default quests that can be accepted at the quest counter. They are unlocked in succession after completing the previous stage and have varying completion objectives. These objectives range from killing a certain number of enemies, completing different <i>Emergency Codes,</i> defeating a particular type of enemy. Arks Quests usually involve one or two areas.</p><h4><a href=\"http://i.minus.com/i5FYAYTSxdgFU.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">Emergency Quests</a></h4><p>Emergency Quests are daily events that will show up at the quest counter for a limited time during that day. Players are alerted of an Emergency Quest through a radio message <a href=\"http://i.minus.com/ibqRdCPaeg0U3C.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">(the scrolling text at the top of the screen)</a> and cannot invite AI partners into the quest. They are located in a warzone/city area, are <b>timed</b> missions, and involve three areas. Area 1 is a solo stage which may or may not involve an <i>Emergency Code</i> mini-quest. Area 2 is a public area that contains a higher enemy count and higher chance of PSE Burst, with an equal chance of one or more <i>Emergency Code</i> mini-quests. The third and final area is an <i>Emergency Code: Dual</i> with a boss, usually of significant difficulty.</p><p><b><a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/WoSgl.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">Story Quests</a></b></p><p>These quests are unlocked through the Matter Board and progress the game's story. They can only be played in a solo party.</p><h3><a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/vRvXM.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">Client Orders</a></h3><p>Client Orders are character specific quests that you can accept on both floors of the ship. These characters will have objectives to give for you, some preset and some daily. Certain client orders may involve both types of quests within one.</p><h4>Goal</h4><p>Goal client orders are quests that need to be completed under certain conditions, usually involving S-ranking a mission under a certain amount of time. Some goal quests might also involve S-ranking a mission with <b>only</b> one specific AI partner.</p><h4>Item Collection</h4><p>Collection client orders are relatively self-explanatory. Kill X amount of enemies, collect Y amount of items, acquire X drop from Y enemy.</p><h3>Matter Board</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8124/2259922-pso20120708_165831_007.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2259922\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.80153846153846\" data-width=\"650\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 650px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:80.2%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8124/2259922-pso20120708_165831_007.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2259922\"><img alt=\"The Matter Board and a legend to explain its symbols\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8124/2259922-pso20120708_165831_007.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8124/2259922-pso20120708_165831_007.jpg 650w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/8124/2259922-pso20120708_165831_007.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8124/2259922-pso20120708_165831_007.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Matter Board and a legend to explain its symbols\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8124/2259922-pso20120708_165831_007.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8124/2259922-pso20120708_165831_007.jpg 650w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/8124/2259922-pso20120708_165831_007.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/8124/2259922-pso20120708_165831_007.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Matter Board and a legend to explain its symbols</figcaption></figure><p>The Matter Board is used to progress through the game's story. It contains multiple pages of quest orbs and completing quests on the board will unlock the connecting orbs. Each board has a set number of bright orbs and completing these orbs will unlock the next story quest. The objectives in the Matter Board can be all types of activities, with some orbs even being as simple as talking to a specific character. Most Matter Board objectives, though, are specifically focused on getting a specific type of enemy to drop a specific type of item. Unlike Client Orders and most other in-game quest systems, enemies only drop those specific items when the correct spot on the Matter Board is selected before leaving the ship and starting a mission. Once the player has started a mission, the Matter Board can not be changed.</p><p>Once the next story quest is unlocked and completed, a new page on the Matter Board opens up. Players may still return to the previous Matter Board to finish incomplete orbs.</p><h3>Emergency Code</h3><p>During certain quests, <i>Emergency Code</i> events, also known as \"interrupts\", may trigger. This can be at random or because of a quest objective, and they come in multiple variations:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Emergency Code Name</th><th>Timed?</th><th>Objective</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><b><i>Arrest</i></b></td><td>Yes</td><td>Capture a pre-determined amount of enemies within your immediate area before the timer runs out. This is almost always a situation where Nab Rappies <i>(The yellow bird-like enemies)</i> need to be killed, only they vanish instead of burrowing away into the ground. However, showing hostility to the targeted enemy will cause them to run and escape, and escaping enemies can hurt your final rank.</td></tr><tr><td><b><i><a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/8VYkS.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">Attack</a></i></b></td><td>No</td><td>The most common of all EC mini-quests and involves killing a preset number of enemies within your immediate area. If there are less enemies nearby than there are left to complete the EC, the game will immediately spawn more enemies. <i>EC: Attack</i> can only be failed if the player dies, as the game will usually close off the area around the player. On occasion, a rare type of <i>Attack</i> can appear where the player is pitted against a powerful enemy and a few less powerful enemies. <a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/Hxg1x.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">The HUD will display the <i>Emergency Code</i> in red if this is the case</a>. The fight will, however, play out exactly like an <i>Emergency Code: Duel.</i></td></tr><tr><td><b><i>Avoid</i></b></td><td>Yes</td><td>The most difficult of all ECs. An invincible enemy spawns within the area and a timer starts. The player must avoid dying or being hit more than twice by the enemy, or else the EC is failed. It is possible to escape this <i>Emergency Code</i> by using a Telepipe and warping back into the area, as it nullifies the EC. It can also be nullified by moving on to the next area.</td></tr><tr><td><b><i>Collect</i></b></td><td>No</td><td>A giant wall preventing progression will appear at the start of this EC. Three boxes will randomly spawn in the area in succession from each other. When the player collects the third box, the player will then be asked to bring the items to the door. This will remove the wall and the EC will be complete.</td></tr><tr><td><b><i><a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/vfwhS.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">Duel</a></i></b></td><td>No</td><td>A fancy title for \"boss fight\". <i>EC:D</i>s will take place in a dedicated area (although they can <i>very</i> rarely show up in the wild) and will involve fighting a significantly more difficult enemy until it is defeated. Completing a Duel will cause the enemy to drop a large crystal containing multiple smaller drops.</td></tr><tr><td><b><i>Destruction</i></b></td><td>No</td><td>A large sphere appears in a random location on the map. This sphere must be destroyed to complete the Code, and its health meter is shown underneath the game's on-screen map. As it takes damage, it grows in size and begins to spawn more and more enemies to help protect the sphere. The EC is completed when the sphere is destroyed. Killing the enemies it spawns is optional.</td></tr><tr><td><b><i><a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/dQ1Lg.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">Elimination</a></i></b></td><td>Yes</td><td>Similar to <i>Attack,</i> only a time limit is added to the fight. If all enemies are not taken out at the end of the timer, the EC is failed.</td></tr><tr><td><b><i>Protection</i></b></td><td>No</td><td>The opposite of <i>Destruction</i>. A crashed ship appears in a random spot on the map and enemies swarm to attack it. The player must defend the ship from the enemies as the ship's crew repair it. The ship's repair meter is displayed underneath the map. Once fully repaired, the ship leaves and the EC is completed.</td></tr></tbody></table><p><i><u>Additional note</u>: While this may not be the case with every EC, it possible for certain Emergency Codes to stack.</i> <i><b>Attack</b> and <b>Collect</b>, for example, can stack on occasion in the Caves area. There is no penalization for completing one before the other, or failing one whilst the other is active.</i></p><h2>Free-to-Play</h2><p>Though playing Phantasy Star Online 2 is <a href=\"/free-to-play/3015-1308/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1308\">free</a> for all players, there are a number of items and features that can be acquired via Arks Cash.

Players take control of the protagonist, Oliver, to explore the world. Oliver can move around towns and cities, interacting with different characters. Players explore the game's large world on an over-world map, similar to those found in older RPGs.</p><p>Enemies wander around the world, and battles are initiated when the player comes into contact with them. Combat is played out in real-time, with a meter that must fill for the player to perform an action (similar to the active-time battle system of <a href=\"/final-fantasy/3025-194/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-194\">Final Fantasy</a>). Central to the combat are the creature-like avatars, or \"familiars,\" which the player can summon in combat to assist them.</p><h2>Familiars</h2><p>In combat, the player can opt to do battle with Oliver\u2019s own wizarding skills, or have him summon a familiar to the fore to do battle for him. Familiars share the same health and mana bar as Oliver and as a result cannot be relied on as fodder for strong attacks in place of Oliver himself as should a familiar die, Oliver will die too.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2451/2441075-2441023-3702130018-Ni-No.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2441075\" style=\"width: 279px\" data-ratio=\"0.78136200716846\" data-width=\"279\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:78.1%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2451/2441075-2441023-3702130018-Ni-No.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2441075\"><img alt=\"Stamina is shown as the yellow circle around each familiar portrait\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 279px) 100vw, 279px\" data-width=\"279\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2451/2441075-2441023-3702130018-Ni-No.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2451/2441075-2441023-3702130018-Ni-No.jpg 279w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Stamina is shown as the yellow circle around each familiar portrait\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2451/2441075-2441023-3702130018-Ni-No.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2451/2441075-2441023-3702130018-Ni-No.jpg 279w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 279px) 100vw, 279px\" data-width=\"279\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Stamina is shown as the yellow circle around each familiar portrait</figcaption></figure><p>However familiars have varied stats and resistances that can make them more useful depending on an enemy\u2019s strengths and weaknesses and knowing which to use when is the key to success in Ni No Kuni\u2019s battle system. A single familiar cannot be used overlong in one fight however because of the game\u2019s stamina system. Once a familiar is summoned, its stamina will drain until it must be switched out to recharge.</p><p>Familiars have their own abilities known as \u2018tricks\u2019 that are unique to them as well as their own equipment and accessories.</p><p>Close attention must also be paid to the \u2018creature cage\u2019 in which familiars can be fed treats to increase desired stats. Once a familiar reaches a certain level, it is also possible to change their form completely via \u2018metamorphosis\u2019 which will start them back at level 1, but with increased potential for stat gains and new tricks to learn.</p><h2>Alchemy</h2><p>During his adventure Oliver will, with the help of a friend, learn the art of alchemy, allowing him to combine base ingredients with powerful results.</p><p>Two forms of alchemizing are available. The first can be accomplished by following formulae given to Oliver when talking to various unassuming citizens of towns that can easily be missed. Care should be taken to talk to all citizens once the player has been introduced to alchemy.</p><p>Second, the player can \u2018mix and match\u2019 by picking base ingredients from Oliver\u2019s inventory and either hoping for a result, or knowing an exact recipe beforehand that will always produced a desired item. Such recipes can be found in the wizard\u2019s companion, among other places.</p><h2>Release and Pre-Order Information</h2><p>Ni no Kuni was released in North America on January 22nd, 2013, exclusively for the <a href=\"/playstation-3/3045-35/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-35\">PlayStation 3</a>.
