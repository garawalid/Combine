The explanation given:</p><blockquote><p>Because this is an Igavania game, the gameplay and feel of traditional 2D games is non-negotiable. Even so, IGA decided to go with 2.5D for this project for both financial and artistic reasons. A 2.5D world built on <a href=\"/unreal-engine-4/3015-2551/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2551\">Unreal Engine 4</a> was the right choice to balance development time, graphical fidelity, budget, and scope.</p><p>At the same time, IGA is very excited about exploring the paths a 2.5D style opens up within the classic Igavania formula. As he begins a new chapter of his career as a developer, he's looking forward to trying things that will enhance, rather than detract from, that core gameplay.</p><p>However, we would NEVER discount the fans' love for that classic style. The development team is looking forward to working with backers every step of the way to decide on custom shaders that will give the game a distinctive, hand-crafted look, so there are no surprises. Games like <a href=\"/guilty-gear-xrd-sign/3030-42679/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-42679\">Guilty Gear</a> and <a href=\"/strider/3030-43275/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-43275\">Strider</a> are proof that 2.5D can be handled in a way that honors a classic aesthetic while allowing for new possibilities; that\u2019s what IGA hopes to achieve with this project.</p><p>That said, one section of the castle will feature an area that Miriam can traverse in beautiful retro graphics. We are dubbing this section \u201cthe 8-bit level\u201d although it may be close to 16 bit or 32 bit depending on how we mix it with the full game. While a full-blown 8-bit game doesn't fit into the full budget, backer support allows us to have fun with the development and create a little retro magic in our game.</p></blockquote><p>Stretch goals included getting <a href=\"/david-hayter/3040-39849/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-39849\">David Hayter</a> &amp; <a href=\"/robert-belgrade/3040-40875/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-40875\">Robert Belgrade</a> voice overs in the game.</p><h3>Links</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/iga/bloodstained-ritual-of-the-night\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kickstarter page</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bloodstainedrotn\" rel=\"nofollow\">Facebook page</a></li><li><a href=\"http://iga-bloodstained.tumblr.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tumblr blog</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOU-IZLwstnFKxX3m3_P4fQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">YouTube page</a></li></ul>", "expected_release_day": 18, "expected_release_month": 6, "expected_release_quarter": null, "expected_release_year": 2019, "guid": "3030-49633", "id": 49633, "image": {"icon_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/3103078-box_bsrotn.png", "medium_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_medium/3103078-box_bsrotn.png", "screen_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/screen_medium/3103078-box_bsrotn.png", "screen_large_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/screen_kubrick/3103078-box_bsrotn.png", "small_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_small/3103078-box_bsrotn.png", "super_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_large/3103078-box_bsrotn.png", "thumb_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_avatar/3103078-box_bsrotn.png", "tiny_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_mini/3103078-box_bsrotn.png", "original_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/3103078-box_bsrotn.png", "image_tags": "All Images"}, "image_tags": [{"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-49633/?filter=image_tag%3AAll+Images", "name": "All Images", "total": 20}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-49633/?filter=image_tag%3Aart", "name": "art", "total": 1}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-49633/?filter=image_tag%3APAX+East+2019", "name": "PAX East 2019", "total": 4}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-49633/?filter=image_tag%3AScreenshots", "name": "Screenshots", "total": 8}], "name": "Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night", "number_of_user_reviews": 0, "original_game_rating": [{"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-1/", "id": 1, "name": "ESRB: T"}], "original_release_date": null, "platforms": [{"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-17/", "id": 17, "name": "Mac", "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/mac/3045-17/", "abbreviation": "MAC"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-94/", "id": 94, "name": "PC", "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/", "abbreviation": "PC"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-129/", "id": 129, "name": "PlayStation Vita", "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-vita/3045-129/", "abbreviation": "VITA"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-143/", "id": 143, "name": "PlayStation Network (Vita)", "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-network-vita/3045-143/", "abbreviation": "PSNV"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-145/", "id": 145, "name": "Xbox One", "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-one/3045-145/", "abbreviation": "XONE"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-146/", "id": 146, "name": "PlayStation 4", "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-4/3045-146/", "abbreviation": "PS4"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-152/", "id": 152, "name": "Linux", "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/linux/3045-152/", "abbreviation": "LIN"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-157/", "id": 157, "name": "Nintendo Switch", "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/nintendo-switch/3045-157/", "abbreviation": "NSW"}], "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/bloodstained-ritual-of-the-night/3030-49633/"}, {"aliases": null, "api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-49717/", "date_added": "2015-05-21 09:47:13", "date_last_updated": "2019-06-15 06:01:45", "deck": "A fantasy JRPG developed for mobile devices, the story of a young skyfarer who seeks out their father, picking up several friends and enemies along the way. Includes music and artwork from former Final Fantasy designers.", "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Granblue Fantasy is a role-playing video game developed by Cygames for Android and iOS, and can be played through some web browsers. The game was released in Japan in March 2014. It does not have an official Western release, but there is an \"International\" edition where most of the game is subtitled in English. The game is notable for reuniting music composer Nobuo Uematsu and art director Hideo Minaba, who previously worked on multiple Final Fantasy titles together.</p><h2>Plot</h2><p>The Captain (the player character, either <a href=\"/gran/3005-39799/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-39799\">Gran</a> or <a href=\"/djeeta/3005-39800/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-39800\">Djeeta</a> by default) and their winged lizard-like friend Vyrn are relaxing in the town of Zinkenstill, when The Captain inadvertently comes to the rescue of a girl named Lyria and an Imperial Officer named Katalina as they try to escape from the Empire. However, the Captain suffers a mortal wound during the fight, forcing Lyria to merge her soul with them in order to bring them back from the brink of death.</p><p>With the Captain and Katalina's fates now tied to Lyria, the three of them decide to head to the island of Estalucia, both to escape from the Empire and find clues about the Captain's estranged father.</p><p>Unfortunately, Katalina's poor piloting skills cause them to crash-land elsewhere in the Port Breeze Archipelago. The trio look for a working airship and a pilot to steer it, and end up meeting Rackam, an odd helmsman working on an airship that has been broken for years. At first, he's reluctant to help them. However, after the Empire follows them to the island, the party convinces Rackam to help them fight off the Imperial soldiers chasing them, and in return help him finish repairing his airship, The Grandcypher, to make it skyworthy.</p><p>As the Captain travels across the skies, gathering up more allies on their journey and fighting Primal Beasts, the crew find themselves slowly dragged into a plot involving the mysterious Black Knight, the doll-like Orchis, and the history that the Empire seeks to keep secret while they pursue Lyria.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Preparation</h3><p>First, the player selects their class from a list. They start as a default Fighter, but can later switch classes to a different specialty as they wish, or unlock more powerful classes later in the game. If they have maxed out a class level, they can gain a \"subskill\" from that class to equip with any other class. Furthermore, the player must select a weapon that is compatible with that class. Each class can only use one of two weapon types.</p><p>Next, the player can choose up to five units they currently own to deploy on the battlefield with The Captain as four active units, and two sub units, who will be swapped in to replace any active party members are killed. The player can also choose up to five Summon creatures, with one leader providing bonuses to the party throughout the stage, and one extra Summon from their friends list or a random player.</p><h3>Battle</h3><p>Once a stage has been selected and any cutscenes have been viewed or skipped, the player will find themselves in 1-3 battles depending on the selected challenge. The player must combine their characters' strengths and weaknesses to progress through the game. The player can use as many skills as they want, and one Summon, provided they are not on cooldown. The turn only progresses once the player has selected the Attack command. Once the party's attack is over, the enemy party will attack with their own skills.</p><p>If any player characters meter reaches 100%, they will launch a Critical Art (C.A.) with their next attack. If multiple characters launch their C.A. at the same time, a Burst attack follows that will match the element of the first character to use a C.A. The player has the option to order their party to hold their C.A. until everyone has a full meter.</p><p>Likewise, enemy characters have a given number of charge diamonds, and when they are filled, they will release a special skill of their own. Boss characters may have an Overdrive meter that fills when they are attacked, making their own attacks and skills even more powerful than before. However, the player's party can use their own skills and attacks to send an enemy from Overdrive status into Break, where their attacks and defenses will be weaker for a short period.</p><h3>Elemental Affinities</h3><p>All units in the game fall within one of six elemental affinities:</p><ul><li>Wind</li><li>Earth</li><li>Water</li><li>Fire</li><li>Light</li><li>Dark</li></ul><p>Most standard battles will be resolved depending on elemental advantage between the attacker and the target(s):</p><table data-max-width=\"true\"><thead><tr><th scope=\"col\">This Element...</th><th scope=\"col\">...is stronger than</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Wind</td><td>Earth</td></tr><tr><td>Earth</td><td>Water</td></tr><tr><td>Water</td><td>Fire</td></tr><tr><td>Fire</td><td>Wind</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Light and Dark affiliated units are weak to each-other's attacks, but are neutral against all other elements.</p><h2>Economy</h2><p>The game runs off a <a href=\"/gacha-system/3015-8997/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-8997\"><em>gacha</em> system</a>, where characters, weapons, and Summons are gained primarily through in-game currency of crystals which can be purchased with real money, or earned by completing tasks in the game. Each draw may contain special weapons that add their attached characters to the party.

It follows the story of two siblings in a world called Grimoire and will feature characters from previous <a href=\"/final-fantasy/3025-194/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-194\">Final Fantasy </a>games, such as <a href=\"/cloud-strife/3005-321/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-321\">Cloud Strife</a> from <a href=\"/final-fantasy-vii/3030-13053/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13053\">Final Fantasy VII.</a> The game features gameplay that will be reminiscent of the earlier games in the series but the team also wants this title to be accessible to a younger audience.</p><p>The story is set in a new world not seen before in the Final Fantasy series, a place teeming with classic Final Fantasy characters and monsters alike. Lann and Reyne, two siblings suffering from <a href=\"/amnesia/3015-286/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-286\">amnesia</a>, must navigate this world of <a href=\"/super-deformation/3015-1196/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1196\">chibi</a>-style monsters and characters. Lann and Reyne are able to move between chibi-form and their other form and, as of this time, it seems like they might be the only characters who are able to do so.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>According the <a href=\"http://worldoffinalfantasy.square-enix.com/us/\" rel=\"nofollow\">official website</a>, the player must master an all new battle system where players will utilize captured monsters, called Mirages, to create powerful towers of monsters to fight enemies throughout the game world. The size, element, and order in which the monsters are used is also something that the player will have to keep in mind. The battle system is said to be inspired by the <a href=\"/active-time-battle/3015-95/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-95\">Active Time Battle</a> system of the <a href=\"/super-nintendo-entertainment-system/3045-9/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-9\">Super Nintendo </a>era.</p><p>The concept of stacking was suggested by <a href=\"/shinji-hashimoto/3040-16624/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-16624\">Shinji Hashimoto</a> after Hashimoto saw a sketch done by <a href=\"/yasuhisa-izumisawa/3040-93888/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-93888\">Yasuhisa Izumisawa</a> of a Magitek Armour with multiple other monsters stacked on top. The stacking element, which would be difficult to render, led to a time of meditation concerning which platforms would be able to display this effect in the best way. In the end it was decided that the Playstation 4 would be the best place for the game, but the team also wanted players to be able to access the game in shorter bursts so they developed a version for the Playstation Vita which utilized the Playstation <a href=\"/cross-save/3015-7556/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7556\">cross-saving</a> feature.</p><p>Mirages are befriended after they have been weakened in battle, a system reminiscent of the <a href=\"/poke-ball/3055-425/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-425\">Poke Ball</a> system used to capture creatures in the <a href=\"/pokemon/3025-452/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-452\">Pokemon</a> series of video games. There are also special Mirages that can be summoned into battle using <a href=\"/action-points/3015-637/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-637\">Action Points</a> (AP), these Mirages will stay in battle until the summoner's AP has been completely consumed.</p><p>The player can customize their monster parties by turning their monsters into ability-boosting Magicite, leveling and evolving them to gain new specializations, or even just use them as a means to get from one place to another; like the iconic, lovable <a href=\"/chocobo/3005-10126/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-10126\">Chocobo</a>.</p><p>The dungeons of this world have been described as vertically stacked and since stacking the caught monsters is also a key component, this game seems to be using space in a very different way. The stacking portion of the game will help the player get past obstacles and progress farther into the game.</p><h2>Development</h2><p>The director of the game <a href=\"/hiroki-chiba/3040-16564/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-16564\">Hiroki Chiba </a>has been a designer and writer at <a href=\"/square-enix/3010-104/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-104\">Square Enix</a> but this is is directorial debut. He worked on <a href=\"/dirge-of-cerberus-final-fantasy-vii/3030-5571/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5571\">Dirge or Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII</a> and, most recently, on <a href=\"/final-fantasy-type-0/3030-21848/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21848\">Final Fantasy Type-0</a>.</p><p>The normal sized characters in the game were designed by zipper aficionado <a href=\"/tetsuya-nomura/3040-637/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-637\">Tetsuya Nomura</a>. The chibi designs were done by <a href=\"/yasuhisa-izumisawa/3040-93888/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-93888\">Yasuhisa Izumisawa</a>, who is known for his other chibi FF project <a href=\"/final-fantasy-crystal-chronicles/3030-15672/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15672\">Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles</a>. The chibi designs were originally drawn for <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.square_enix.android_googleplay.pictlogicaff\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pictlogica Final Fantasy</a>, a mobile spin-off, but it seems that the images are being used in collaboration with World of Final Fantasy. Chiba consulted with Nomura on how best to meld the old, iconic character designs with the new chibi designs without causing damage to the overall iconic image of the characters.</p><p>The game is being developed on the Orochi 3 engine to help speed up development. The game was said to be 30 to 40% complete as of June 2015 when it was debuted at E3 that year.</p><h2>Characters</h2><h4><strong>Lann </strong>/ \u30e9\u30a1\u30f3 (<em>Raan</em>)</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15946/2954792-016_intro.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2954792\" data-ratio=\"2.0954810495627\" data-width=\"1372\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1372px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:209.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15946/2954792-016_intro.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2954792\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15946/2954792-016_intro.png\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15946/2954792-016_intro.png 1372w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/15946/2954792-016_intro.png 916w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/15946/2954792-016_intro.png 458w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15946/2954792-016_intro.png 305w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 305px) 100vw, 305px\" data-width=\"305\"></a></figure><p>To a casual observer, Lann may appear brash and impulsive.

\"hardcore restaurant sim\" adds new food prep mechanics, several dozen new recipes, and the ability for players to customize the look of their own restaurant.", "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Cook, Serve, Delicious! 2!! is a restaurant simulation game developed and originally published by <a href=\"/vertigo-gaming-inc/3010-11360/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-11360\">Vertigo Gaming</a> for <a href=\"/pc/3045-94/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PC</a> in 2017. As the sequel to the original <a href=\"/cook-serve-delicious/3030-40093/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-40093\">Cook, Serve, Delicious!</a>, the player is cast as the successful proprietor of the eponymous restaurant from the first game. However, an embezzlement scheme perpetrated by the owners of SherriSoda Tower leads to the bankruptcy and closure of most of the tower's resident businesses, including the player's restaurant. After buying new commercial space inside the massive Teragon Supertower, players must rebuild their restaurant from the ground up into the prestigious five-star eatery it once was.</p><p>A <a href=\"/playstation-4/3045-146/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-146\">PlayStation 4</a> version of the game has been announced as \"coming soon\".</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Like the original Cook, Serve, Delicious!, the sequel's core gameplay revolves around managing a busy restaurant over the course of an entire day. Although the main focus is on <a href=\"/cooking/3015-850/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-850\">preparing food</a>, players must also handle <a href=\"/janitor/3015-8691/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-8691\">sanitation</a>-related tasks such as washing dishes, cleaning toilets and taking out the garbage. One daily shift begins at 6:50 AM and ends at 10 PM, with lunch and dinner \"rushes\" occurring at 12 PM and 6 PM respectively; the in-game clock moves at a highly accelerated rate compared to <a href=\"/real-time-game-clock/3015-2519/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2519\">real time</a>.</p><p>CSD2 supports console-style gamepad controllers in addition to standard mouse and keyboard options.</p><h3>Prep Stations</h3><p>Several Prep Stations, represented by a row of numbered tabs, are displayed along the left edge of the gameplay screen. When a customer places an order, their order ticket appears next to one of the available Prep Station tabs as an image showing the type of food ordered. Players can select a new order ticket to begin preparation of the order; this opens the Prep Station menu displaying the food item or its basic ingredients. Kitchen equipment such as plates, pans, deep fryers or flat-top grills may also be shown when required for certain recipes.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/34/342363/2964255-20170914215854_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2964255\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/34/342363/2964255-20170914215854_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2964255\"><img alt=\"Making Cereal at a Prep Station\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/34/342363/2964255-20170914215854_1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/34/342363/2964255-20170914215854_1.jpg 1920w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/34/342363/2964255-20170914215854_1.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/34/342363/2964255-20170914215854_1.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/34/342363/2964255-20170914215854_1.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Making Cereal at a Prep Station</figcaption></figure><p>Inside the Prep Station menu, the actual preparation and assembly of ingredients takes place by selecting the correct recipe options displayed in the right-hand window. Once the initial prep work is finished, pressing Enter will either serve the order immediately or begin cooking it, depending on the dish. Although certain recipes have steps that must always be performed (such as filleting a <a href=\"/fish/3015-3780/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3780\">Fish</a>), many types of food have several different preparation or ingredient customization options; for example, a customer's <a href=\"/corn-dog/3055-3188/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-3188\">Corn Dog</a> order may specify the addition of mustard, ketchup, both or neither. The specific details of an order are shown in a ticket window at the bottom of the Prep Station menu.</p><p>Most kinds of food must be allowed to fully cook before serving, as indicated by a timer icon on the order ticket. Once the cooking timer is complete, the food is usually ready to serve and its order ticket must be selected again to remove it from the heat source before it burns. However, some of the more complex foods (especially those with <a href=\"/meat/3055-267/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-267\">meat</a> as an ingredient) begin with an extra preparation step before cooking, after which the ticket must be selected again to complete the final preparation steps prior to serving.</p><h3>Patience, Ratings &amp; Chores</h3><p>Once an order is placed, players only have a limited amount of time in which to assemble and serve the requested food item before the customer loses their patience and leaves the restaurant; this is represented by their order ticket slowly sliding off of the screen.</p><p>Depending on the accuracy of the finished order's ingredient placement and whether the food was fully cooked, the player will receive a \"Perfect,\" \"Average\" or \"Bad\" rating. Perfect orders are obviously the most desirable and increase customer traffic and revenue. Average orders have no positive or negative effect, and Bad orders drive away customers. If an order is not filled before its ticket disappears from the Prep Station tab, or if the food is burnt during cooking, the order is automatically rated Bad.</p><p>Cleaning chores periodically appear on the Prep Station tabs as work tickets right alongside customer orders. These tasks are completed in the same way as standard food orders, but their wait timers elapse more quickly. Failing to complete a cleaning task earns an automatic \"Sick\" rating and a substantial decrease in customers.</p><h3>Holding Stations</h3><p>Holding Stations (\"HS\") are displayed at the top of the gameplay screen. A new mechanical addition to CSD2, these auxiliary prep stations are used to make large batches of dishes or ingredients in advance.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/34/342363/2964244-20170914215836_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2964244\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/34/342363/2964244-20170914215836_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2964244\"><img alt=\"Making Pretzels at a Holding Station\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/34/342363/2964244-20170914215836_1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/34/342363/2964244-20170914215836_1.jpg 1920w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/34/342363/2964244-20170914215836_1.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/34/342363/2964244-20170914215836_1.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/34/342363/2964244-20170914215836_1.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Making Pretzels at a Holding Station</figcaption></figure><p>Certain foods require the use of Holding Stations during prep, which are indicated by a red \"HS\" icon, while others are considered \"Holding Station-optional\" as indicated by a yellow \"HS\" icon. If the daily menu contains any foods that are HS-required or HS-optional, time will be paused during a \"pre-open\" phase before the shift begins, giving players a chance to begin prepping their first dish of the day at a Holding Station. As an added convenience, any dishes prepped at a Holding Station that require cooking are automatically removed from the heat source once the cooking timer has finished.</p><p>Effective use of Holding Stations can help make lunch and dinner rushes more manageable, especially when combined with recipes that require little or no additional prep work. For example, once a batch of Pretzels has been fully cooked at a Holding Station, they can be served immediately simply by selecting a customer's Pretzel order in the Prep Station tabs; no further steps are required.</p><p>Holding Station foods have a limited serving life and must eventually be disposed of once they lose their freshness.</p><h3>Food Types</h3><p>All recipes are now split into three main categories: Entrees, Side Dishes and Drinks. Entrees are the restaurant's main source of income and make up the majority of order tickets. Side Dishes can only be prepped in Holding Stations and are never ordered on their own; instead, Sides are ordered automatically alongside Entrees, with the added effect of increasing customers' patience. Drinks are similarly ordered along with Entrees and require regular attention via order tickets to continue serving them, such as refilling the ice dispenser for a Soda machine.</p><p>Entrees served perfectly along with a Side Dish and a Drink will receive an extra \"Delicious\" bonus.</p><h2>Modes</h2><p>Players begin the campaign with a small amount of cash, a sparsely furnished restaurant and a handful of basic recipes. Completing shifts earns the player more money for purchasing new recipes, as well as \"<a href=\"/experience-points/3015-39/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-39\">YUM points</a>\" towards their character's next <a href=\"/leveling-up/3015-475/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-475\">level-up</a>. Leveling up confers several benefits, including bonus recipes and new <a href=\"/interior-decorating/3015-6806/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6806\">decorative</a> options for the player's restaurant. More Prep and Holding Stations are also added to the player's kitchen as they gain levels.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/34/342363/2964240-20170914215756_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2964240\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/34/342363/2964240-20170914215756_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2964240\"><img alt=\"Restaurants in Teragon Supertower\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/34/342363/2964240-20170914215756_1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/34/342363/2964240-20170914215756_1.jpg 1920w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/34/342363/2964240-20170914215756_1.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/34/342363/2964240-20170914215756_1.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/34/342363/2964240-20170914215756_1.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Restaurants in Teragon Supertower\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/34/342363/2964240-20170914215756_1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/34/342363/2964240-20170914215756_1.jpg 1920w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/34/342363/2964240-20170914215756_1.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/34/342363/2964240-20170914215756_1.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/34/342363/2964240-20170914215756_1.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Restaurants in Teragon Supertower</figcaption></figure><p>Selecting \"Cook, Serve, Delicious!\" from the Tower menu allows players to customize their restaurant's daily menu offerings, which must always contain at least three Entrees. Once the daily menu has been confirmed, the shift begins and a list of Bonus Objectives is displayed; completing these optional objectives will unlock new items.</p><p>Aside from players managing their own restaurant, a large number of \"Chef for Hire\" levels are available by selecting any of the other restaurants from the Tower menu. Each restaurant follows a general culinary theme, including ethnic cuisine such as traditional <a href=\"/italy/3035-1451/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1451\">Italian</a>, <a href=\"/japan/3035-37/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-37\">Japanese</a> or <a href=\"/china/3035-343/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-343\">Chinese</a> foods. Selecting one of these restaurants displays a number of different daily shifts that can be worked, each with their own fixed menu offerings.</p><p>The income earned from a single Chef for Hire shift is typically much less than what players would earn working at their own restaurant. However, they can also earn Bronze, Silver and Gold Medals during these shifts by making Perfect orders while avoiding too many Average or Bad orders. Leveling up will eventually unlock additional restaurants and shifts for play.</p><h2>Trivia</h2><p>Leading up the launch of Cook, Serve, Delicious! 2!!, the developer Chubigans broadcast some of the programming of Cook, Serve, Delicious! 2!! live on Twitch in the form of programming streams.

In 2012, Capcom producer Hiroyuki Kobayashi stated that they would consider remaking Resident Evil 2 if there was enough demand from fans. Though despite this claim, it would take until 2014 for any further hints of the possibility of an RE2 remake to surface. On August 5th, 2014, a remastering of the original remake was announced for PS4, PS3, 360, XB1, and PC. Within the same timeframe was a listing of a ''Resident Evil 2 HD'' being briefly shown up on Amazon.com for a release date of September 29th, 2015. Capcom offered no such comment to the listing.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/10354/2770147-2770141-re2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2770147\" data-ratio=\"1.3333333333333\" data-width=\"540\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 540px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:133.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/1/10354/2770147-2770141-re2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2770147\"><img alt=\"'Biohazard 2: New Rebirth Project'\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2770147-2770141-re2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10354/2770147-2770141-re2.jpg 540w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/10354/2770147-2770141-re2.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a><figcaption>'Biohazard 2: New Rebirth Project'</figcaption></figure><p>On July 30th, 2015, a member of Capcom's R&amp;D division took to Facebook to inquire interest about an RE2 remake and what ''the brand is all about'', while also expressing concern with the fan-remake that was in development, titled ''Resident Evil 2 Reborn''. Another developer calling himself ''H'' then took to Facebook, providing an update about how his bosses perceive the idea of an RE2 remake.</p><p>On July 31st, ''H'' posts again, now showing off the logo for an official Biohazard 2 (Japanese title for Resident Evil) remake document and how he was planning on bringing it to his higher ups. Finally, on August 12th, 2015, ''H'' revealed himself to be Capcom producer <a href=\"/yoshiaki-hirabayashi/3040-101308/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-101308\">Yoshiaki Hirabayashi </a>and officially confirmed the development of a Resident Evil 2 remake via a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcW6W-xVl-8\" rel=\"nofollow\">YouTube video</a>.</p><p>When the original director of Resident Evil 2, <a href=\"/hideki-kamiya/3040-60123/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-60123\">Hideki Kamiya</a>, was asked in an interview about wanting to work on an RE2 remake, he said no. He further explained that he prefers working on action games and doesn't actually enjoy horror, that he gets scared too easily.</p><h3>Fan remake</h3><p>Before Capcom began officially acknowledging the possibility of remaking Resident Evil 2, an Italian development team called Invader Games started work in 2011 on their unofficial Resident Evil 2 remake, called Resident Evil 2 Reborn. It was built from the ground up in Unreal Engine 4 (originally Unity), with assets taken from other official Resident Evil games, such as <a href=\"/resident-evil-the-darkside-chronicles/3030-25558/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-25558\">Darkside Chronicles</a> in particular, with many sound effects being ported from the original Resident Evil 2. The gameplay was primarily shown utilising the over-the-shoulder perspective of Resident Evil 4, though there existed a classic fixed camera angle alternative. The remake was to be completely free and was to release in August, 2015.</p><p>On August 17th, the fan remake was officially cancelled. However Capcom simultaneously cancelled the project while still also inviting Invader Games to speak with them to ''further development''. In response, Invader Games made a Facebook post:</p><blockquote><p>Hello everybody!</p><p>First of all we want to thank all of you for the passion and the attachment that you have daily shown us. We'll be always grateful.</p><p>Today we want to join us of a very special day for InvaderGames. After the official announcement of the Resident Evil 2 remake by Capcom, we officialise the end of the works on Resident Evil 2 Reborn.</p><p>Contrary to what might be thought, this is wonderful news for us and, as fans, we're so happy that Capcom has decided to take the lead of the project and to develop the remake awaited for years by everybody (nobody could bring back to life the masterpiece of 1998 better than the creators themselves). Meanwhile as developers, we're honoured to announce that we've been officially invited to meet Capcom.</p><p>Capcom called us up in advance of the announcement and asked us if we would mind stopping the project as they had longer term plans for a Resident Evil 2 Remake. They have invited us to a meeting to discuss further ideas.</p><p>Even though we cannot complete the project of Resident Evil 2 Reborn, we're happy that what we've shown has achieved consents from worldwide fans and especially has been noticed from Capcom itself. We promise that the work done until now will be useful for future projects, we won't disappoint your and our expectations.</p><p>Thank you again for letting us to be where we are now in spite of the long way that remains to be walked through, we hope to focus soon on the biggest professional chance that we could get. Once more, we're very grateful to Capcom for having noticed our work and having appreciated as much the love we feel about the Resident Evil saga as developing videogames. It's very rare to find such a leader company in the industry so much open minded and sensitive to the work of a growing studio like ours, guided by passion and competence.</p><p>News available soon, stay tuned!</p><p>InvaderGames Team</p><p> </p></blockquote><h3>Early Concepts</h3><p>On February 26th 2019, Capcom released the first part of a YouTube series called Roundtable, serving as a celebration of the Remake's release and success. It aims to gather all of the key developers for the remake, to discuss how the remake finally came together as well as revealing early concepts, and ideas that never made it into the game.</p><p>Topics included the surprise and glee that came with the overwhelmingly positive metacritic reception for the game, which most of them had not seen coming. As well as sharing early images of the game's UI, bearing a striking resemblance to that of the classic Resident Evil UI.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/20/208795/3085202-3877218718-resid.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3085202\" data-ratio=\"0.421875\" data-width=\"1920\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:42.2%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/20/208795/3085202-3877218718-resid.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3085202\"><img alt=\"Potential mod incoming?\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/20/208795/3085202-3877218718-resid.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/20/208795/3085202-3877218718-resid.jpg 1920w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/20/208795/3085202-3877218718-resid.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/20/208795/3085202-3877218718-resid.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/20/208795/3085202-3877218718-resid.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Potential mod incoming?\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/20/208795/3085202-3877218718-resid.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/20/208795/3085202-3877218718-resid.jpg 1920w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/20/208795/3085202-3877218718-resid.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/20/208795/3085202-3877218718-resid.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/20/208795/3085202-3877218718-resid.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Potential mod incoming?</figcaption></figure><p>The 1-Shot demo was a proposition that met with a lot of divisive reactions from fans, but also the developers. Director Yasuhiro Anpo elaborates that the gap between the release of the demo and the game, was too wide for him to see a 30 minute demo as being anything but a negative. Ultimately, it didn't hurt the excitement for the game. The developers also expressed how scary the game ended up being, the zombies are tough, but as long as they appear to be damaged by the player's attacks then it wasn't that big of deal. Also how much discussion went into the design of Ada's disguise, like her sunglasses.</p><p>In Part 2, there are talks of which Easter eggs to include in the game, like stuff from the original, or things relating to the development and marketing of the remake. One interesting little detail is the picture of a dog on Jill's desk, the developers wanted her to have one. They also decided to make more interactions between Leon and Ada, making their romance feel more grounded, and not as corny as the original, like not having Leon scream her name as she falls. Some felt it was bit out of place with the more modern graphics, as opposed to the original, others still have a lot of fondness for how it went about in the original game.</p><p>The most noteworthy though were canned ideas, like the pitch of making the railcar that Sherry and Claire uses to get to the NEST be something that would take them up the Arklay Mountains into a remote Umbrella Factory.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/20/208795/3085205-4621135901-resid.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3085205\" data-ratio=\"0.41979166666667\" data-width=\"1920\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:42.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/20/208795/3085205-4621135901-resid.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3085205\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/20/208795/3085205-4621135901-resid.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/20/208795/3085205-4621135901-resid.jpg 1920w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/20/208795/3085205-4621135901-resid.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/20/208795/3085205-4621135901-resid.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/20/208795/3085205-4621135901-resid.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/20/208795/3085205-4621135901-resid.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/20/208795/3085205-4621135901-resid.jpg 1920w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/20/208795/3085205-4621135901-resid.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/20/208795/3085205-4621135901-resid.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/20/208795/3085205-4621135901-resid.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Other ideas included making the Sewer Alligator be a bit more of an involving boss fight rather than a Crash Bandicoot 2-esque escape section.

with 3 galaxies made up of four ships each. The stages are a single screen which have pieces of random generation such as the objective, platform layout, and which vending machines are present.</p><p>Players can jump and shoot by default, but the main weapons have a finite number of ammo. Each stage has a random objective to complete such as to cool generators, use batteries to power generators, or kill all the enemies. On the last ship of a galaxy players must defeat a boss enemy.</p><p>Located randomly in each stage are various vending machines. These vending machines can be used freely, but operate on a cool down. The vending machines can give primary weapons, explosives, and health restoration.</p><h2>System Requirements</h2><h3>PC</h3><table data-max-width=\"true\"><thead><tr><th scope=\"col\">PC Minimum</th><th scope=\"col\">PC Recommended</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Operating System: Windows XP</li><li>Processor: 1.2GHz or faster</li><li>Memory: 1 GB RAM</li><li>Graphics: 256MB of video memory</li><li>Storage: 150 MB available space</li><li>Additional Notes: Best played with controller.</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Operating System: Windows XP</li><li>Processor: 2Ghz</li><li>Memory: 2 GB RAM</li><li>Graphics: 1G of video memory</li><li>Storage: 300 MB available space</li><li>Additional Notes: Best played with controller.</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table><p> </p><h2>External Links</h2><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.mutantalienassault.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Super Mutant Alien Assault</a></li></ul>", "expected_release_day": 12, "expected_release_month": 7, "expected_release_quarter": null, "expected_release_year": 2016, "guid": "3030-51222", "id": 51222, "image": {"icon_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/2949738-image.png", "medium_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_medium/2949738-image.png", "screen_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/screen_medium/2949738-image.png", "screen_large_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/screen_kubrick/2949738-image.png", "small_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_small/2949738-image.png", "super_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_large/2949738-image.png", "thumb_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/scale_avatar/2949738-image.png", "tiny_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_mini/2949738-image.png", "original_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/original/2949738-image.png", "image_tags": "All Images,Cover Art"}, "image_tags": [{"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-51222/?filter=image_tag%3AAll+Images", "name": "All Images", "total": 12}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-51222/?filter=image_tag%3ACover+Art", "name": "Cover Art", "total": 1}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-51222/?filter=image_tag%3APAX+East+2016", "name": "PAX East 2016", "total": 1}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-51222/?filter=image_tag%3AScreenshots", "name": "Screenshots", "total": 9}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-51222/?filter=image_tag%3AXbox+One+Screenshots", "name": "Xbox One Screenshots", "total": 9}], "name": "Super Mutant Alien Assault", "number_of_user_reviews": 0, "original_game_rating": [{"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-2/", "id": 2, "name": "PEGI: 16+"}], "original_release_date": null, "platforms": [{"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-94/", "id": 94, "name": "PC", "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/", "abbreviation": "PC"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-129/", "id": 129, "name": "PlayStation Vita", "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-vita/3045-129/", "abbreviation": "VITA"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-143/", "id": 143, "name": "PlayStation Network (Vita)", "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-network-vita/3045-143/", "abbreviation": "PSNV"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-145/", "id": 145, "name": "Xbox One", "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-one/3045-145/", "abbreviation": "XONE"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-146/", "id": 146, "name": "PlayStation 4", "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/playstation-4/3045-146/", "abbreviation": "PS4"}], "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/super-mutant-alien-assault/3030-51222/"}, {"aliases": null, "api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-51315/", "date_added": "2015-10-22 19:59:02", "date_last_updated": "2019-06-12 17:22:09", "deck": "A peaceful first-person platformer about restoring a vibrant world.", "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Refunct is a first-person platforming game with simple geometric shapes that has the player leaping from tower to tower in order to restore color and vibrancy to the world.

Instead of a sub-class with eight tiers of modifiers, players instead start with an upgrade for the Movement Ability, <a href=\"/grenade/3055-111/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-111\">Grenade</a> Type, and new Class Ability (with most options locked with an \"upgrade point\" system and/or level lock) and can use upgrade points to specialize in one of two sets of abilities (each providing different series of buffs and unique Melee Abilities). Unlike the original Destiny, there are no modifiers for the player's main stats (Mobility, Resilience, and Recovery) and no separate modifier for the <a href=\"/super-combo/3015-6149/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6149\">super ability</a>.</p><p>The game's prologue has players start with either the Gunslinger, Striker, or Voidwalker sub-class. Once the player's Guardian \"loses their Light\", they lose their class-specific abilities (including mid-air movement and the ability to throw grenades) until a certain point in the story (which gives them the Arcstrider, Sentinel, or Dawnblade sub-class). By playing through the game, players can unlock additional sub-classes through special quests that can only be reached at certain player levels.</p><p>Character inventories and progression are not carried over from the original Destiny, although character appearances can be transferred if they reached level 20 and completed the Black Garden mission.</p><h3>Hunter</h3><p>The most agile class of the three, Hunters are former scavengers and can be recognized by their hooded capes and light, fitted armor.</p><p>Their unique ability is the <strong>Dodge</strong>, which allows them to quickly evade attacks in a daring roll or dash maneuver. Players can choose from either <strong>Marksman Dodge</strong> (which also automatically reloads the player's equipped weapon) or <strong>Gambler's Dodge</strong> (which can also generate Melee Attack energy if done in close proximity to an enemy).</p><p>Their movement options involve <a href=\"/double-jump/3015-1/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1\">double-jumping</a>. These include <strong>High Jump</strong> (which upgrades the height of the second jump), <strong>Strafe Jump</strong> (which offers better directional control of the second jump), and <strong>Triple Jump</strong> (which adds a third mid-air jump).</p><h4>Subclasses</h4><ul><li><strong>Arcstrider</strong> (Arc) - Their <strong>Arc Staff</strong> super ability conjures a <a href=\"/bo/3055-1761/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1761\">staff</a> of pure electrical energy, allowing them to be an agile melee powerhouse. Can path into either <strong>Way of the Warrior</strong> (which creates an aftershock on Arc Staff attacks) or <strong>Way of the Wind</strong> (which increases the player's general agility).

Since Season 4, players can unlock <strong>Way of the Wraith</strong>, which replaces the Shadowshot with <strong>Spectral Blades</strong> (which conjures two daggers of void energy and allows them to roam invisible for stealth kills). Their Melee Ability is a smoke bomb toss, which either ensnares enemies (Trapper), <a href=\"/cloak/3015-11/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-11\">cloaks</a> all nearby allies (Pathfinder), or damages them over time (Wraith).</li></ul><h3>Titan</h3><p>The most durable class of the three, Titans are known for building the Wall that protects the Last City and can be recognized by their bulky armor, swept-back helmets, and marked sashes.</p><p>Their unique class ability is the <strong>Barricade</strong>, which allows them to form a temporary barrier of light that negates weapons. Players can choose from either <strong>Towering Barricades</strong> (tall barriers that offers better protection) or <strong>Rally Barricades</strong> (short barriers that can be peeked over by aiming down-the-sight, also instantly reloading the equipped weapon of allies behind it).</p><p>Their movement options involve the mid-air \"Lift\", which propels the Titan to the air and use jump-jets to hover down. These include <strong>High Lift</strong> (which upgrades the overall Lift height), <strong>Strafe Lift</strong> (which offers better directional control of the Lift), and <strong>Catapult Lift</strong> (which provides a quick Lift propulsion).</p><h4>Subclasses</h4><ul><li><strong>Sentinel</strong> (Void) - Their <strong>Sentinel Shield</strong> super ability conjures a wielded shield of void energy that can negate enemy attacks, be used to <a href=\"/shield-bash/3015-4315/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4315\">bash enemies</a>, and be thrown at enemies as a boomerang. Can path into either <strong>Code of the Protector</strong> (which gives an option to create an impenetrable shielding dome instead) or <strong>Code of the Aggressor</strong> (which allows additional Sentinel Shield throws). Since Season 4, players can unlock <strong>Code of the Commander</strong>, which improves the Sentinel Shield's barrier. Their Melee Ability either creates an overshield on all nearby allies after a kill (Protector), unleashes a devastating shield bash while sprinting (Aggressor), or set off void explosions from other void abilities (Commander).</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Striker</strong> (Arc, unlocked after level 5+) - Their <strong>Fist of Havoc</strong> super ability supercharges the Titan's fists, allowing powerful melee dashes and <a href=\"/ground-pound/3015-1532/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1532\">ground slams</a>.

Their Melee Ability either unleash a hammer strike while sprinting (Fire-Forged), causes an explosion that burns nearby enemies (Siegebreaker), or throws a retrievable solar hammer (Devastator).</li></ul><h3>Warlock</h3><p>The most arcane class of the three, Warlocks studied the Light of the Traveler through scholarly means and can be recognized by their robes, rounded helmets, and \"bonds\" (a special type of armband).</p><p>Their unique ability is the <strong>Rift</strong>, which allows them to conjure a temporary well of Light that continually buffs allies inside it. Players can choose from either <strong>Healing Rift</strong> (which <a href=\"/healer/3015-188/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-188\">heals</a> them) or <strong>Empowering Rift</strong> (which increases their attack power).</p><p>Their movement options involve gliding in the air. These include <strong>Controlled Glide</strong> (which offers better directional control of the glide), <strong>Focused Burst</strong> (which provides an intial speed burst on the glide), and <strong>Balanced Glide</strong> (which provides a bonus to both speed and control of the glide). The Voidwalker sub-class is unique as it replaces the Focused Burst with <strong>Blink</strong> (allowing a quick <a href=\"/teleportation/3015-8/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-8\">teleportation</a> effect).</p><h4>Subclasses</h4><ul><li><strong>Dawnblade</strong> (Solar) - Their <strong>Daybreak</strong> super ability conjures flaming <a href=\"/sword/3055-1/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1\">swords</a> that can be thrown at enemies.

Unlike the original Destiny, where the two main weapon slots are based on the weapon type (Primary or Special), Destiny 2 splits up the slots based on <a href=\"/elemental-weapons/3015-5843/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5843\">elemental</a> type: Kinetic (non-elemental) and Energy (either Arc, Solar, or Void). Kinetic weapons work best against unshielded enemies while Energy weapons work best against shields of the same elemental type. Power weapons are always elemental and deal heavy damage at the cost of limited ammunition. All weapons are replenished by picking up ammo of their weapon type (white boxes for Primary, green boxes for Special, and purple boxes for Power).</p><p>Prior to the Forsaken update, Special weapons were instead categorized as Power weapons and both basic weapon slots were restricted to Primary weapons. Ammo boxes were also color-coded based on weapon slots (with white boxes for Kinetic and green boxes for Energy).</p><h3>Rarities &amp; Perks</h3><p>Like the original Destiny, weapons come in multiple <a href=\"/color-coded-loot/3015-4702/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4702\">color-coded rarities</a> (including grey Basics, green Commons, blue Rares, purple Legendaries, and golden Exotics). As players level up, they earn weapons of a rarer variety more often (with the highest level skipping Basics and Commons entirely).</p><p>Rarer weapons include additional perks and bonuses, including the ability to upgrade their level (by \"infusing\" them with other weapons of the same type), apply weapon mods to them, customize their perk choices, and customize their appearance (using Shaders for Legendary weapons and rare Ornaments for Exotic weapons). Unlike the original Destiny, all weapons no longer have dedicated \"upgrade paths\".</p><p>Beginning with the Curse of Osiris expansion, players can earn and craft rarer \"Masterwork\" variants of each Legendary weapon, granting stat tracking and an additional minor stat boost of a random choice (which could be re-rolled). This system was later changed to a separate upgrade system for all weapons added since the Forsaken expansion. For Exotic weapons, players can find rare \"Catalysts\" that add a progression system, with a fully-progressed Catalyst unlocking a more powerful Masterwork upgrade.</p><p>All pre-Forsaken weapons have a curated set of perks which are not randomly-generated. This was changed for weapons added since the Forsaken expansion, where their perks are randomly picked. Regardless, rarer weapons give players the option to choose from groups of perks (such as different <a href=\"/scope/3055-738/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-738\">scopes</a> and magazine types).</p><h4>Intrinsic Perks</h4><p>All weapons have Intrinsic Perks, which partly determine their base stats and play style. Some weapons have unique changes based on their Intrinsic Perk (for example, semi-automatic weapons with Rapid-Fire Frame fire in fully-automatic). All Exotic weapons have their own unique Intrinsic Perk.</p><ul><li><strong>Adaptive Frame</strong> - Balanced.</li><li><strong>Aggressive Frame</strong> - Sacrifices recoil control for higher damage output.</li><li><strong>High-Impact Frame</strong> - Sacrifices firing/projectile speed for higher damage output. Improves accuracy while both stationary and aiming down the sight.</li><li><strong>Lightweight Frame</strong> - Increases the wielder's mobility while equipped.</li><li><strong>Precision Frame</strong> - Improves horizontal recoil control.</li><li><strong>Rapid-Fire Frame</strong> - Increases ammo reserves. Improves reloading speed on an empty magazine.</li></ul><h3>Primary Weapons</h3><p>Primary weapons are the most common used weapons, and use standard Primary Ammo that is common to find. In PvP, players spawn with a large amount of ammunition.</p><ul><li><a href=\"/assault-rifle/3055-413/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-413\"><strong>Auto Rifles</strong></a> - Fully-automatic. Their intristic perks include Adaptive, High-Impact, Lightweight, Precision, and Rapid-Fire frames.</li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"/bow/3055-73/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-73\"><strong>Combat Bows</strong></a> - Hand-drawn.

Some Adaptive Sidearms fire in three-round bursts.</li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"/submachine-gun/3055-766/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-766\"><strong>Submachine Guns</strong></a> - Fully-automatic. Their intristic perks include Adaptive, Aggressive, Lightweight, and Preicision frames. Aggressive Submachine Guns also deal bonus damage at close range. New to the series.</li></ul><h3>Special Weapons</h3><p>Formerly part of the Power type, Special weapons are more powerful than Primary weapons and use Special Ammo that is slightly less common to find. In PvP modes, players spawn with a very limited amount of ammunition.</p><p>Some Exotic Special Weapons are instead treated as Power Weapons and use that slot and the Power ammo type. In addition, the Fighting Lion Grenade Launcher is instead treated as a Primary Weapon and use the Primary ammo type.</p><ul><li><a href=\"/railgun/3055-25/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-25\"><strong>Fusion Rifles</strong></a> - Charge-shot. Fires a barrage of bolts and is charged by holding down the Primary Fire button.

Depending on perks, grenades have a wide variety of projectile types and purposes (including <a href=\"/proximity-mines/3055-1309/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1309\">proximity grenades</a> that <a href=\"/sticky-bombs/3055-224/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-224\">stick onto surfaces</a> and grenades that blind or stun enemies). Unlike drum-fed Grenade Launchers, these have no alternate intristic perks. New to the series.</li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"/shotgun/3055-114/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-114\"><strong>Shotguns</strong></a> - Pump-action. Their intristic perks include Aggressive, Lightweight, and Precision frames. Some shotguns with Aggressive Frame include a temporary firing rate buff after each kill. Some Precision Shotguns fire with <a href=\"/shotgun-slug/3055-4511/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-4511\">single-slug</a> rounds instead of pellets, significantly reducing the spread of each shot (and requiring more precise aiming for devastating impact).</li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"/sniper-rifle/3055-67/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-67\"><strong>Sniper Rifles</strong></a> - Semi-automatic. Their intristic perks include Adaptive, Aggressive, and Rapid-Fire frames. Rapid-Fire Sniper Rifles are fully-automatic.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Trace Rifles</strong> - Continuous. Fires a continuous beam of energy. Currently only exist as Exotic weapons. New to the series.</li></ul><h3>Power Weapons</h3><p>Power weapons are more powerful than both Primary and Special weapons and use Power Ammo (sometimes known in-game as Heavy Ammo) that is less common to find. In PvP modes, players spawn with no ammunition at all, and can only find them in two places: as time-locked crates in specific locations or as loose crates dropped by those killed while carrying Power ammo. The kill feed also displays when an ammo is picked up, by who, and with what Power weapon type.</p><ul><li><strong>Grenade Launchers</strong> (Drum-Fed) - Multi-shot. Depending on perks, grenades have a wide variety of projectile types and purposes (including <a href=\"/proximity-mines/3055-1309/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1309\">proximity grenades</a> that <a href=\"/sticky-bombs/3055-224/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-224\">stick onto surfaces</a> and grenades that blind or stun enemies). Their intristic perks include Adaptive, Aggressive, and Precision frames. Precision Grenade Launchers sacrifice projectile speed for projectiles that bounce against hard surfaces and detonate on trigger release. New to the series.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Linear Fusion Rifles</strong> - Charge-shot. Fires a single, powerful, precise bolt and is charged by holding down the Primary Fire button. Unlike standard Fusion Rifles, these have no alternate intristic perks.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Machine Guns</strong> - Fully-automatic. Added in Season 5 and currently requires the Forsaken expansion.</li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"/rocket-launcher/3055-211/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-211\"><strong>Rocket Launchers</strong></a> - Single-shot. Their intristic perks include Adaptive, High-Impact, Aggressive, and Precision frames. Precision Rocket Launchers lock onto targets when aimed at, auto-tracking.</li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"/sword/3055-1/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1\"><strong>Swords</strong></a> - Melee. When equipped, the game is played in a third-person <a href=\"/over-the-shoulder/3015-2621/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2621\">over-the-shoulder</a> perspective. Unlike other weapons, swords can be used in a weaker capacity without ammo. Heavy ammo gives special powered attacks (either Uppercut, Dash, or Slam, depending on the intristic perk) and Sword Guards (which allow players to use Heavy Ammo to guard against enemy attacks, both melee and ranged).</li></ul><h2>Campaign</h2><h3>Prologue</h3><ol><li><strong>Homecoming</strong> (The Tower)</li><li><strong>Exodus</strong> (The Last City)</li><li><strong>Spark</strong> (EDZ)</li></ol><h3>The Red War</h3><ol><li><strong>Combustion</strong> (EDZ)</li><li><strong>Hope</strong> (Titan)</li><li><strong>Riptide</strong> (Titan)</li><li><strong>Utopia</strong> (Titan)</li><li><strong>Looped</strong> (Nessus)</li><li><strong>Six</strong> (Nessus)</li><li><strong>Sacrilege</strong> (Io)</li><li><strong>Fury</strong> (Io)</li><li><strong>Payback</strong> (EDZ)</li><li><strong>Unbroken</strong> (EDZ)</li><li><strong>Larceny</strong> (EDZ)</li><li><strong>1AU</strong> (The Almighty)</li><li><strong>Chosen</strong> (The Last City)</li></ol><h3>Curse of Osiris</h3><ol><li><strong>The Gateway</strong> (Mercury)</li><li><strong>A Deadly Trial</strong> (EDZ)</li><li><strong>Beyond Infinity</strong> (Mercury)</li><li><strong>Deep Storage</strong> (Io)</li><li><strong>Tree of Probabilities</strong> (Mercury)</li><li><strong>Hijacked</strong> (Nessus)</li><li><strong>A Garden World</strong> (Mercury)</li><li><strong>Omega</strong> (Mercury)</li></ol><h3>Warmind</h3><ol><li><strong>Ice and Shadow</strong> (Mars)</li><li><strong>Pilgrimage</strong> (Mars)</li><li><strong>Off-World Recovery</strong> (EDZ)</li><li><strong>Strange Terrain</strong> (Mars)</li><li><strong>Will of the Thousands</strong> (Mars)</li></ol><h3>Forsaken</h3><ol><li><strong>Last Call</strong> (Prison of Elders)</li><li><strong>High Plains Blues</strong> (Tangled Shore)</li><li><strong>Scorned</strong> (Tangled Shore)</li><li><strong>The Machinist</strong> (Tangled Shore)</li><li><strong>Nothing Left to Say</strong> (Tangled Shore)</li></ol><h2>Vanguard Strikes</h2><p>The game's traditional co-operative activity pits up to three players in a single mission (similar in length to campaign missions and adventures), ending with a final confrontation against a <a href=\"/boss-fight/3015-50/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-50\">boss</a>. By completing Strikes, players can earn unique gear from <a href=\"/zavala/3005-37682/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-37682\">Commander Zavala</a>.</p><p>Prior to the Forsaken expansion, Strikes were only playable as its own matchmaking playlist. This was changed so that players can play individual Strikes by accessing them on the Map screen of each planet.</p><p>Beginning with the Curse of Osiris expansion, more difficult versions of Strikes were made available on a separate \"Heroic Strikes\" playlist. This later replaced the normal Strikes playlist, and can be played in multiple Power level-based difficulty settings. Along with a difficulty increase and more rewards, it adds three gameplay modifiers that change every week, one of each type (Burn, Advantage, and Disadvantage).</p><h3>Strike List</h3><h4>The Red War</h4><ul><li><strong>The Arms Dealer</strong> (EDZ) - Bracus Zahn (Cabal Legionary)</li><li><strong>Exodus Crash</strong> (Nessus) - Thaviks, the Depraved (Fallen Marauder)</li><li><strong>The Inverted Spire</strong> (Nessus) - Protheon, Modular Mind (Vex Minotaur)</li><li><strong>Lake of Shadows</strong> (EDZ, timed exclusive to the PS4 version) - Grask, the Consumed (Taken Phalanx)</li><li><strong>The Pyramidion</strong> (Io) - Brakion, Genesis Mind (Vex Hobgoblin)</li><li><strong>Savath\u00fbn's Song</strong> (Titan) - Savath\u00fbn's Song (Hive Shrieker)</li></ul><h4>Curse of Osiris</h4><ul><li><strong>A Garden World</strong> (Mercury, based on the mission of the same name) - Dendron, Root Mind (Vex Cyclops)</li><li><strong>Tree of Probabilities</strong> (Mercury, based on the mission of the same name) - Valus Thuun (Cabal Centurion)</li></ul><h4>Warmind</h4><ul><li><strong>The Insight Terminus</strong> (Nessus, timed exclusive to the PS4 version) - Kargen, the Technocrat (Cabal Psion)</li><li><strong>Strange Terrain</strong> (Mars, based on the mission of the same name) - Nokris, Herald of Xol (Hive Prince)</li><li><strong>Will of the Thousands</strong> (Mars, based on the mission of the same name) - <a href=\"/xol-will-of-the-thousands/3005-37718/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-37718\">Xol, Will of the Thousands</a> (Hive Worm God)</li></ul><h4>Forsaken</h4><ul><li><strong>Broodhold</strong> (Tangled Shore, timed exclusive to the PS4 version) - In An\u00e2nh, Brood Queen (Hive Wizard)</li><li><strong>The Corrupted</strong> (The Dreaming City) - <a href=\"/sedia/3005-39797/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-39797\">Sedia, the Corrupted</a> (Taken Techeun)</li><li><strong>The Hollowed Lair</strong> (Tangled Shore, based on the mission Scorned) - Fikrul, the Fanatic (Scorned Baron)</li><li><strong>Warden of Nothing</strong> (Prison of Elders) - The Mad Warden (Fallen Servitor)</li></ul><h3>Nightfall</h3><p>A special endgame playlist, \"Nightfall Strikes\" are even more challenging versions of Strikes with a very large difficulty increase, special rewards, a unique scoring system, and a limited map selection that changes every week. Unlike other Strike playlists, these cannot be played in standard matchmaking and require players to form pre-made fireteams. Players can opt to use the Guided Games feature to form three-man fireteams (with two clanmates as the \"Guides\" and one other player as the \"Seeker\").</p><p>Prior to the Forsaken expansion, these came in Normal and Prestige variants (with Prestige playlists disabling the Guided Games functionality and further increasing the game's difficulty to the game's then-maximum Power level), have limited mission timers (failing the mission entirely when it reaches zero), and used special modifiers (including \"time warps\" that allow players to extend the mission timer in special ways).</p><p>Beginning with the Warmind expansion, teams are scored based on the performances of all three players together. Scoring is gained by both killing enemies (primary) and generating Orbs of Light (secondary) and is lost gradually over time. After 15 minutes, players earn less points. After 18 minutes, players can no longer earn points. Players can also use special Challenge Card items to further increase the difficulty and apply a set of modifiers (one Burn, one Advantage/Disadvantage, and two Disadvantage), all of which add a multiplier to the scoring system.</p><h3>Heroic Modifiers</h3><p>Along with Heroic Strikes and Challenge Cards, these modifiers are also applied to Heroic Adventures, the Heroic Story Mission playlist, and certain Activities (including the Reckoning and the Managerie).</p><h4>Burn Modifiers</h4><ul><li><strong>Arc Singe</strong> - +25% damage with/from Arc weapons and abilities.</li><li><strong>Solar Singe</strong> - +25% damage with/from Solar weapons and abilities.</li><li><strong>Void Singe</strong> - +25% damage with/from Void weapons and abilities.</li></ul><h4>Advantage Modifiers</h4><ul><li><strong>Brawler</strong> - 2x melee damage and recharge speed.</li><li><strong>Grenadier</strong> - 2x grenade damage and recharge speed.</li><li><strong>Heavyweight</strong> - 2x Power weapon damage, 3x Power ammo drop rate.</li></ul><h4>Disadvantage Modifiers</h4><ul><li><strong><strong>Attrition</strong></strong> - Challenge Card only.

Automatic health/shield regeneration is disabled unless the player is moving. Faster health/shield regeneration while sprinting.</li></ul><h2>Raids</h2><p>Returning from the original Destiny, these unique endgame <a href=\"/player-vs-environment/3015-349/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-349\">PvE</a> events pit a fireteam of <a href=\"/raid/3015-247/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-247\">up to six Guardians</a> against a series of challenging stages in unique locations. Each stage has unique objectives and constraints that require heavy use of teamwork, strategy, puzzle-solving, and communication. Completing through these stages unlock unique and powerful loot, including tokens for unique Engrams.</p><p>Each raid has two difficulties: Normal and Prestige. Prestige raids give additional (and exclusive) rewards while increasing the difficulty of all enemies and adding new challenges to each mission. The player's current raid progress, regardless of difficulty, is reset at the start of the weekly rotation. Players in a smaller fireteam (known as \"Seekers\") can use the Guided Games feature to pair up with larger fireteams (known as \"Guides\") to form a full team for the latest Raid.</p><ul><li><strong>Leviathan</strong> - Set on the massive Cabal space vessel (of the same name) orbiting around Nessus, Leviathan has the players invited by <a href=\"/emperor-calus/3005-37837/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-37837\">the former Emperor of the Cabal Empire</a> to test their strength against his Loyalist forces. Unlike previous Raids, Leviathan uses a central hub area (the Castellum) to link all four chambers together. Players need to clear three of these chambers (Royal Pools, Pleasure Gardens, and The Gauntlet) before facing off against Emperor Calus himself in his throne room. As progressing through the Castellum is a challenge in itself, players can optionally sneak inside a hidden part of the ship (the Underbelly) to skip the Castellum and find hidden loot.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Leviathan, Eater of Worlds</strong> - Added in Season 2. Players are summoned back to the Leviathan by Calus to venture deep inside the vessel to find and destroy the <a href=\"/argos-planetary-core/3005-39792/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-39792\">Planetary Core Argos</a>.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Leviathan, Spire of Stars</strong> - Added in Season 3. Players are summoned back to the Leviathan to repel a Cabal Red Legion assault on the vessel and assassinate the fleet's leader: <a href=\"/val-cauor/3005-39790/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-39790\">Val Ca'uor</a>.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Last Wish</strong> - Added in Season 4. Set in the Dreaming City, Last Wish has players making their way to a massive tower (the Keep of Voices) while freeing two Techeuns (Kalli and Shuro Chi) from Taken corruption. Afterwards, they must defeat the tower's guard (a powerful Taken Ogre known as the Spirekeeper Morgeth), find a way to enter the Vault, and destroy the corrupted Ahamkara known as <a href=\"/riven-of-a-thousand-voices/3005-37838/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-37838\">Riven of a Thousand Voices</a>.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Scourge of the Past</strong> - Added in Season 5. Set in a desolate section of the Last City (now occupied by a Fallen syndicate known as Kell's Scourge), Scourge of the Past has players navigating the city to the Black Armory Vault and preventing the massive war-mech <a href=\"/insurrection-prime/3005-39791/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-39791\">Insurrection Prime</a> from plundering it.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Crown of Sorrow</strong> - Added in Season 7. Players are summoned back to the Leviathan to clear Hive infestation and retrieve the Crown of Sorrow (a Hive artifact believed to be used to command the Hive) from the corrupted Cabal <a href=\"/gahlran/3005-39789/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-39789\">Gahlran</a>.</li></ul><h2>Crucible</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2940021-d2_pvp_action_04.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2940021\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2940021-d2_pvp_action_04.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2940021\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/30/2940021-d2_pvp_action_04.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2940021-d2_pvp_action_04.jpg 1920w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/30/2940021-d2_pvp_action_04.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/2940021-d2_pvp_action_04.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/30/2940021-d2_pvp_action_04.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/30/2940021-d2_pvp_action_04.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2940021-d2_pvp_action_04.jpg 1920w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_super/0/30/2940021-d2_pvp_action_04.jpg 960w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/2940021-d2_pvp_action_04.jpg 480w, https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/30/2940021-d2_pvp_action_04.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Like the original Destiny, <a href=\"/player-vs-player/3015-346/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-346\">PvP</a> multiplayer takes place in-universe in the Crucible: a series of live-fire training exercises that doubles as gladiatorial competition.</p><p>Each Crucible match takes place in dedicated arenas (most of which use environmental assets from areas used for PvE), with <a href=\"/lord-shaxx/3005-37685/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-37685\">Lord Shaxx</a> as the mode's primary announcer. By completing public matches, players can earn unique Crucible-themed gear for use in any mode.</p><p>At launch, the game had no private matches, no ranking system, and a player limit of 8 (restricted to two teams of four players). Along with the addition of private matches and two ranking systems (Valor and Glory), the game later increased the player limit to 12 and added free-for-all play.</p><p>As of the Forsaken update, each player has two separate rankings that reset each Season:</p><ul><li><strong>Valor</strong> - Used for all public modes, Valor tracks the player's overall Crucible experience for a particular Season. While players can earn additional Valor by winning consecutive matches, they can never lose Valor. When players reach the maximum Valor Rank (Legend), they can choose to <a href=\"/prestige/3015-7677/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7677\">reset it back to zero</a> to gain additional rewards and commendations.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Glory</strong> - Used solely for the Competitive playlist, Glory tracks the player's skill in the playlist in relation to other players. Players can earn additional Glory by winning consecutive matches, and lose Glory by losing matches and disconnecting from games.</li></ul><h3>Game Modes</h3><p>Unlike in the original Destiny, Destiny 2 simplifies the scoring system so that bonus points (such as headshots and assists) do not count towards the team's score.</p><ul><li><strong>Clash</strong> - Standard <a href=\"/team-deathmatch/3015-2463/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2463\">team deathmatch</a>. Teams earn points for eliminating enemy combatants.</li></ul><ul><li><strong><strong>Control</strong> </strong>- Objective-based <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/conquest-mode/3015-1099/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1099\">\"conquest\" mode</a>, where teams fight over three neutral <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/control-point/3015-187/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-187\">Points</a> throughout the battlefield. Neutral and enemy Points can be captured for the team by standing on them uncontested for a short amount of time. Teams earn points both for eliminating enemy combatants (with bonus points based on how many Points they control) and for capturing a Point. In Competitive settings, each team starts with one Point controlled.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Supremacy</strong> - Team deathmatch with a twist: killed players drop colored \"crests\" (blue for teammates, red for enemies) that can be collected. Teams can only earn points by picking up enemy Crests, and picking up a teammate's crest denies the opportunity for the enemy team to score with it.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Survival</strong> - Team deathmatch with a twist: games are played in rounds and teams only have a limited amount of <a href=\"/lives/3015-323/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-323\">lives</a>. Teams win rounds by depleting the enemy team of their life count and then eliminating them. If the round timer is depleted, the team with the most lives remaining wins the round. Based on Elimination mode from the original Destiny.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Countdown</strong> - Round-based asymmetrical <a href=\"/assault/3015-3294/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3294\">assault mode</a> where the Attacking team must prevent the Defending team from arming and detonating a central charge at one of two points in a specific time limit. Although players only have one life per round, they can be revived by teammates. Teams win rounds by either by eliminating the enemy team or by completing their objective. New for Destiny 2.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Mayhem Clash</strong> - Similar to Clash. All Guardian abilities and Heavy ammunition crates recharge faster. Added on December 19, 2017.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Showdown</strong> - Team deathmatch with a twist: games are played in two-minute rounds. Teams win rounds by having the highest amount of kills when the round timer is depleted. New for Destiny 2. Added on February 13, 2018.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Rumble</strong> - Free-for-all <a href=\"/deathmatch/3015-451/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-451\">deathmatch</a>. Players earn points for eliminating enemy combatants. Added on March 27, 2018.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Iron Banner Control</strong> - Similar to Control. Once a team captures all three points at once (and gains a \"Power Play\"), the points remain locked for 15 seconds before they all reset. New for Destiny 2. Added on September 18, 2018 and not available in Private Matches.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Breakthrough</strong> - Round-based symmetrical assault mode where teams fight to capture a central neutral control point (or \"deploying the Breaker\"). Once a team deploys the Breaker, they must capture their enemy's control point (or \"hacking the Vault\") to win the round. If they fail to hack the Vault, the other team wins the round. New for Destiny 2. Added on September 25, 2018 and requires the Forsaken expansion for use in Private Matches.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Lockdown</strong> - Similar to Control. However, the game is now a round-based system where kills no longer contribute to the score. Teams slowly earn points by capturing and holding two uncontested zones. If all zones are captured and uncontested, the holding team wins the round automatically. New for Destiny 2. Added on November 27, 2018 (formerly a Crucible Labs playlist since July 26, 2018).</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Crimson Days Doubles</strong> - Similar to Showdown. Players who are close together gain the \"Reunited\" buff (increasing the recharge rate of their abilities), while players who are too far apart gain the \"Drifting Apart\" debuff (marking them as waypoints for the enemy). When a player's teammate is defeated, they gain the \"Vengeance\" temporary buff (further increasing the recharge rate of their abilities while slightly healing them). New for Destiny 2. Added on February 12, 2019 and not available in Private Matches.</li></ul><h4>Crucible Labs</h4><ul><li><strong>Scorched / Team Scorched</strong> - Similar to Rumble / Clash. All loadouts are replaced with one weapon with very high ammo: the Scorch Cannon. New for Destiny 2.

In addition, Saladin replaces Shaxx as the mode's announcer.</p><p>Prior to Season 4, the playlist was restricted to one gametype that rotates every month (Clash, Control, or Supremacy). This was later changed to a special variation of Control (known as \"Iron Banner Control\") and introduced the return of Power level advantages (where players with higher Power levels have increased damage and resistance).</p><p>Since Season 5, certain medals received their own Iron Banner counterpart that is earned exclusively in that mode. Season 6 added two new consumables: the Iron Burden (which gives a handicap of -100 Power in the Iron Banner for 30 minutes, available for purchase) and the Wolf's Favor (which gives a handicap of +100 Power in the Iron Banner for 30 minutes, earned by completing Daily/Weekly Challenges).</p><h3>Trials of the Nine</h3><p>The sequel to the \"Trials of Osiris\" event in the original <a href=\"/destiny/3030-36067/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-36067\">Destiny</a>, Trials of the Nine was a special weekly endgame event where players participate in a series of highly-competitive matches on a specific map and gametype (either Survival or Countdown) that cycles each week. It was later discontinued in Season 4.</p><p>Unlike standard playlists, players must form their full four-player fireteam before entering matchmaking and cannot modify their chosen loadout while in the playlist. Each match's introduction is extended and shows the loadout of all players individually (allowing teams to coordinate on countering their foes).</p><p>Each event duration starts on Friday and ends at the weekly reset. Once the player's character reaches either 7 wins or 3 losses, that character can no longer participate in the event for that week. Depending on the amount of wins, the player can enter parts of an exclusive location (The Third Spire) to spend on unique themed gear.</p><h2>Gambit</h2><p>Added in Season 4, Gambit is a unique \"competitive PvE\" game mode that pits two groups of four-man fireteams against each other to summon and destroy a powerful boss enemy (the Taken Primeval). While it have elements of PvP multiplayer, it is outside of the scope of the Crucible and does not count towards Crucible bounties and challenges.</p><p>In-universe, Gambit is a secret competition hosted by a mysterious Lightbearer , known as the <a href=\"/the-drifter/3005-37708/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-37708\">Drifter</a>, in order to generate and harness the Darkness (as portable \"Motes\"). It takes place at locations near the Drifter's ship (the Derelict, which tows a gigantic mysterious object throughout the solar system), with the beginning of each round taking place inside the ship. Further lore behind Gambit and the Drifter's intentions are explained in both Forsaken (through lore books) and Joker's Wild expansions.</p><p>Similar to the Crucible's Valor ranking system, Gambit has Infamy ranks which tracks their public Gambit experience throughout the season. While players can earn additional Infamy by winning consecutive matches, they can never lose Infamy (although at the highest Rank, they gain no Infamy by losing). When players reach the maximum Infamy Rank (Legend), they can choose to <a href=\"/prestige/3015-7677/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7677\">reset it back to zero</a> to gain additional rewards and commendations.</p><h3>Gameplay</h3><p>In Gambit, games are played in rounds, with the first team to win two rounds winning the match. At the beginning of the match, an enemy faction is randomly determined, which will spawn naturally for the entirety of the match (outside of the Primeval phase).</p><p>When each round begins, both teams spawn in the spawn area of their battlefield, with the battlefields of both teams being both completely identical and separate. Each battlefield has a central area (where a \"Mote Bank\" and an \"Invasion Portal\" are located) and three enemy spawn areas (each of which are named by the Drifter when enemies spawn, such as \"the Cavern\" and \"the Base\").</p><p>Enemies of the chosen faction then spawn in one of these areas, with enemies dropping anywhere from 1-5 \"Motes of Dark\" based on their difficulty. Once all enemies are cleared from that area, they begin spawning in one of the two other spawn areas. Although Motes disappear after a short amount of time, players can collect them to keep them in their possession (up to 15 at a time). Players can then deposit their current stack of Motes to their team's Bank, provided there are no enemy Blockers alive. If a player dies while holding a stack of Motes, that stack is \"lost\" and removed from the game.</p><p>Once a team deposits 75 or more Motes in their Bank, they begin their Primeval Phase, which removes all faction enemies from their battlefield, locks the Bank, and begins spawning unique Taken enemies near the Bank. The objective of this phase is to eliminate the boss \"Primeval\" (who is both lethal and very tanky). To help hasten the death of the Primeval, a stacking \"Primeval Slayer\" buff is applied automatically to the team (first after 30 seconds, then after every 12 seconds). In addition, eliminating both of the Primeval's lieutenants (the Taken Wizards known as \"Primeval Envoys\") grant an additional \"Primeval Slayer\" buff.</p><p>Once the Primeval is defeated, the round ends and the team who defeated their Primeval first wins the round. In normal Gambit matches after the Gambit Prime update, the final tie-breaking round (when more than one round is needed to win) is changed to immediately start at the Primeval Phase.</p><h4>Value Targets</h4><p>At certain times of the match, a more powerful \"High-Value Target\" can spawn in a random location and roams throughout the battlefield. Damaging HVTs causes it to drop Motes, while defeating HVTs drop a large amount of Motes (up to 15 total).</p><p>In addition, teams that are behind in score can find glowing \"Catch Up Targets\" with spawned enemies, each of which drop additional Motes on death.</p><p>Both HVTs and CUTs can be disabled in Private Matches.</p><h4>Bank Blocking</h4><p>When a player deposits 5 or more Motes at a time, they send a \"Blocker\" to the enemy battlefield near their Bank. As long as an enemy Blocker is alive, that team's Bank is \"blocked\" and cannot be used.</p><ul><li>For 5-9 Motes, <strong>Taken Goblins</strong> are deployed as Small Blockers, whose ability to shield other Taken from all damage made them annoying in groups. Prior to the Gambit Prime update, these were <strong>Taken Phalanxes</strong>.</li></ul><ul><li>For 10-14 Motes, <strong>Taken Captains</strong> are deployed as Medium Blockers, whose lethality made them dangerous for players holding onto motes . Prior to the Gambit Prime update, these were <strong>Taken Knights</strong>.</li></ul><ul><li>For the maximum amount of Motes (or 15-19 Motes in Gambit Prime), <strong>Taken Knights</strong> are deployed as Large Blockers, whose tankiness made them tougher to dispatch. Prior to the Gambit Prime update, these were <strong>Taken Ogres</strong>.</li></ul><p>With the addition of the High-Yield Savings perk in Gambit Prime (and exclusive to that mode), Collectors can deposit 20 Motes to send a Giant Blocker (a boss <strong>Taken Phalanx</strong>) to the other side. Giant Blockers are risky to obtain, but are very dangerous to dispose of (due to their large shields, their tankiness, and their lethal stomp attack).</p><p>Players can still send Blockers to the enemy's side when their enemies are in the Primeval Phase, which can be detrimental to that team (as distractions and shields).</p><h4>Player Invading</h4><p>Reminiscent of the Invader Phantom system in the <a href=\"/souls/3025-2169/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-2169\">Souls</a> series, players can \"invade\" the opposing team's battlefield once their Portal is active (which happens after each 25 motes deposited as a team, or at regular intervals during the enemy's Primeval Phase).</p><p>Invaders are transported to the furthest spawn area from the opposing players, are highlighted in red, have all enemy Guardians marked on their HUD, and cannot be targeted or damaged by PvE enemies. Their goal is simply to eliminate enemy Guardians while avoid being killed themselves. After either 30 seconds have passed or four enemy Guardians are eliminated, the Invader is automatically transported back to their battlefield. If they are killed, they drop 3 Motes around them, lose their current stack of Motes, and must wait to respawn at their battlefield.</p><p>Teams who are being invaded are notified (with heavy aural and visual cues) and have an incentive to hunt the Invader down:</p><ul><li>If the Invader kills an enemy Guardian prior to the Primeval Phase, that Guardian loses their stack of Motes. This can be detrimental for those carrying large stacks.</li></ul><ul><li>If the Invader kills an enemy Guardian during the Primeval Phase, the Primeval gets healed for a small amount.</li></ul><h3>Gambit Prime</h3><p>Added in Season 6 and only available to owners of the Annual Pass, Gambit Prime is a unique single-round version of Gambit with numerous changes:</p><ul><li>Players can earn special armor pieces from the Reckoning activity that gives them points towards special perks for Gambit Prime. Perks are split into four combat roles: Reaper (green, focusing on clearing waves of enemies and defeating powerful enemies), Invader (red, focusing on invading enemy teams), Collector (white, focusing on gathering motes and sending Blockers), and Sentry (yellow, focusing on defending against both Blockers and Invaders).</li></ul><ul><li>The number of banked motes that are required to summon a Primeval is increased from 75 to 100, and can be drained over time in two ways: when multiple Blockers are near the Bank, and when invaders with a certain Invader perk are standing near the Bank.</li></ul><ul><li>The Primeval can only be damaged for a short time after all three Envoys are defeated. The third Envoy spawns after the other two is defeated and leaves a Well of Light once defeated (granting temporary buffs to those standing in it). After a short time, the Primeval is shielded and more Envoys spawn.</li></ul><h3>Maps</h3><h4>Gambit + Gambit Prime</h4><ul><li><strong>Emerald Coast</strong> (European Dead Zone, Earth) - Enemies are either Cabal, Fallen, or Hive.

Idolizing his wealthy, harsh father, Evan was driven to become a mass-murderer to stop a worker's uprising. He now stalks the Entity's playground, setting immobilizing bear traps to ensnare Survivors who don't watch where they step as well as where they're going. Wielding a makeshift cleaver, Evan's abilities are focused on quickly hooking and sacrificing Survivors.</p><p>Complexity: EASY</p><h4>The Wraith</h4><p>Philip Ojomo immigrated to America to follow the dream of prosperity and self-made manhood. Instead, he wound up entangled in the seedy world of organized crime at the auto yard he worked at. Catching his boss disposing of a person in the car crusher, he went on a rampage of vengeance before being drawn into the Entity's game. A folk spirit of revenge, Ojomo can shift into the spirit realm, leaving only the slightest shimmer as he hunts his victims with horrid subtlety. His Perks focus on tracking Survivors wherever, or however, they flee.</p><p>Complexity: Intermediate</p><h4>The Hillbilly</h4><p>Max Thompson, Jr. was born a deformed child of wealthy parents who hid their shameful, mutant child away on their ranch. Taking direct inspiration from Leatherface (the devs thought they'd never be able to get the Texas Chainsaw license, and created a rough analog), he broke free and slaughtered his parents with his hammer and chainsaw. The latter is his special ability, allowing him to rev and then charge forward with shocking speed and almost no fine control. This gives him both a traversal mechanic and an extremely powerful ability to catch up with, and take down, Survivors in a single hit and his Perks only reinforce this relentless pursuit.</p><p>Complexity: Easy</p><h3>Post-Release</h3><h4>The Nurse</h4><p>Added on August 18, 2016 and released with the <em>Last Breath</em> chapter.</p><p>Sally Smithson was forced to take a nursing position at the ill-reputed Crotus Prenn Asylum after her husband met with an unfortunate factory accident. There, she was slowly driven mad by the horrors she witnessed in those cursed halls and enacted an overnight mass-murder of patients and staff members, using her own hands to choke or the utilitarian bonesaw to cut, releasing them from the misery of the Asylum by her own twisted hand. The ambulance that took her away never made it to its destination, a wreckage found crashed in a cursed wood with no sign of Sally to be found. Inspired by any number of paranormal ghosts haunting abandoned hospitals, The Nurse can quickly close distances by warping to Survivors through the spirit world. No one is safe for long as her perks focus almost entirely on revealing and tracking Survivors.</p><p>Complexity: Hard</p><h4>The Hag</h4><p>Added on December 8, 2016 and released with the <em>Of Flesh and Mud</em> chapter.</p><p>Based around the \"witch of the wilds\" archetype, Lisa Sherwood grew up in a small, isolated village where ancient traditions were still practiced and arcane symbols were used to keep trouble away, or occasionally draw it in. Kidnapped during a storm by depraved men, she was kept chained in a cellar while they fed from pieces carved off of her living body. Eventually too emaciated and infected to be kept shackled, she broke free and collapsed, writing out one final symbol of vengeance in the mud and the muck. When her fellow villagers stumbled upon the shack she'd been kept in, they only found the disemboweled bodies of those who'd previously lived there, but she had vanished into the swamp. Channeling her thirst for blood and want for vengeance through her Hexes, she can set traps and then immediately teleport to them and her Perks offer up different effects as she inflicts further pain and suffering upon any Survivors unfortunate enough to be caught up in her claws.</p><p>Complexity: Intermediate</p><h4>The Doctor</h4><p>Added on May 11, 2017 and released with the <em>Spark of Madness</em> chapter.</p><p>Herman Carter became obsessed with the human mind from an early age, pursuing a career in psychology and showing an aptitude for it that was nothing short of genius. Recruited by the enigmatic and sinister Mr. Stamper for an off-the-books CIA project, Herman was unleashed upon the \"patients\" of the Lery Memorial Institute and given carte blanche to extract information through any means necessary. Undisturbed as screams echoed through the halls, the man dubbed \"The Doctor\" was left alone for years as lights began flickering more and more often, electroshock becoming Carter's preferred method of interrogation. After a week of silence, Mr. Stamper was discovered in Carter's office, skull opened and electrodes attached to his still-living brain in a futile attempt to unlock the secrets of mind control. Carter himself was never seen again, the institute shuddered and all information redacted. He now stalks the Entity's world, electric prod in-hand, ready to shock Survivors into fits of madness with his powers. His Perks allow him to run the battlefield, sabotaging Survivor's efforts as he goes.</p><p>Complexity: Hard</p><h4>The Huntress</h4><p>Added on July 27, 2017 and released with the <em>A Lullaby for the Dark</em> chapter.</p><p>The daughter of a survivalist mother, Anna grew up in the middle of the northern woods of Russia. When her mother died suddenly, impaled on the antlers of an elk the two were tracking and humming a gentle lullaby as the life faded from her, Anna was left to fend for herself using the hunter's skills that she'd learnt from her. Expanding her territory, and the size of her prey, the little girl grew into a hulking woman and began hunting The Most Dangerous Game, while stealing away any little girls she found to try and rebuild her shattered family. As war descended on Russia, German soldiers would be found butchered with massive axes in the woods, but no trace of the massive beastwoman was ever found. Anna wields hatchets to hit and disable prey at a distance, her haunting lullaby preceding her. Her Perks are varied, allowing her to track and beguile Survivors as they try to evade her sight.</p><p>Complexity: Intermediate</p><h4>The Clown</h4><p>Added on June 12, 2018 and released with the <em>Curtain Call</em> chapter.</p><p>Everybody loves a clown, or so the song claims. But Kenneth Chase, born in 1932, found love in short supply after his difficult birth killed his mother and drove a permanent wedge between he and his increasingly alcoholic father. A curious, athletic child, Kenneth eventually began to collect feathers that he found scattered on his walk to and from school. Becoming obsessed with the birds that left the feathers, the boy availed himself of a local dentist's anesthetic, creating a trap in his bird feeder and, eventually, killing any bird that came to rest there. Eventually graduating to larger prey, he became fascinated by the ability to immobilize a creature and literally hold its life in his hand before snuffing it out. Eventually, a young man went missing and Kenneth's father discovered the gruesome trophies his boy had kept, which now included a man's finger. Fleeing from his home, Kenneth eventually stumbled into a traveling circus and, at last, found a group of misfits to fit in with. Taking the name \"Jeffery Hawk,\" he became a clown. What could be more disarming to unsuspecting victims? When one such victim escaped and exposed him, Hawk fled once again, eventually finding himself in a realm where his penchant for anesthetic and knives could be put to permanent use. His perks give him incredible mobility and confound Survivors' efforts to work together.</p><p>Complexity: Intermediate</p><h4>The Spirit</h4><p>Added on September 18, 2018 and released with the <em>Shattered Bloodline</em> chapter.</p><p>Drawing inspiration from J-Horror films like The Ring and The Grudge, Rin Yamaoka comes from a family of Japanese samurai, warriors that struck terror and devastation on the field of battle. Her father, an overworked salaryman, went into a murderous rage after his unjust firing, murdering Rin's bedridden, sickly mother and attempting to do the same to his daughter. Driven by the Entity's whispers, he nearly succeeded, shattering his family's ancestral katana as it bathed in the blood of his family, until the Entity saw in Rin greater fury and fire, and moved its influence to her, reanimating her to seek screaming vengeance with that very same blade that would not claim her. She can traverse the map in spirit form, emerging to strike quickly at unsuspecting Survivors. Her Perks are focused on seeing her prey at a great distance, so she can close in and attack quickly.</p><p>Complexity: Hard</p><h4>The Legion</h4><p>Added on December 11, 2018 and released with the <em>Darkness Among Us</em> chapter.</p><h4>The Plague</h4><p>Added on March 19, 2019 and released with the <em>Demise of the Faithful</em> chapter.</p><h3>Post-Release (Guest)</h3><h4>The Shape</h4><p>Added on October 25, 2016, released with the <em>HALLOWEEN</em> chapter, and a guest character from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween_(franchise)\" data-target=\"true\" data-nofollow=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">the Halloween film series</a>.</p><p>From the terrifying horror film franchise \"Halloween,\" Michael Audrey Myers murdered his sister Halloween Night in 1963 when he was only a small boy. Fifteen years later, his reign of terror continued and across the decades, he's shed gallons of blood, silently peering from behind his blank mask. Dr. Sam Loomis attempted to corral the heartless killer, to understand then to contain him, but Michael continues to escape. To stalk. To kill. Drawn into the Entity's game willingly, given a bottomless well of victims to inflict pain and death upon, Michael stalks from the shadows, his power growing into a horrific, violent crescendo. His perks assign one Survivor as an \"obsession\" of Michael, giving him powerful abilities centering around them, either to keep them alive until last, or kill them immediately.</p><p>Complexity: Hard</p><h4>The Cannibal</h4><p>Added on September 14, 2017, released with the <em>LEATHERFACE</em> DLC, and a guest character from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Texas_Chainsaw_Massacre_(franchise)\" data-target=\"true\" data-nofollow=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">the Texas Chainsaw Massacre film series</a>.</p><p>Bubba \"Junior\" Sawyer's reputation is known to anyone who was a fan of horror exploitation films of the 1970s, though he's better known by his moniker Leatherface. Born the youngest child of a degenerate family of meat packers, Bubba was terrified of displeasing his abusive family and would do anything to earn their approval. Up to and including murder and slaughter. After being thwarted in his attempt, after seeing his brother run down by a pickup truck driver who rescued his quarry, Leatherface was drawn into the Entity's world with the promise of another powerful figure he'd have to satisfy. And he would, for this creature offered much more than filial ties and well-being, it offered him an endless feast of flesh and victims for him to use his hammer and chainsaw against. His Perks focus on robbing them of their advantages and abilities in the face of his onslaught.</p><p>Complexity: Easy</p><h4>The Nightmare</h4><p>Added on October 26, 2017, released with the <em>A Nightmare on Elm Street</em> chapter, and a guest character from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Nightmare_on_Elm_Street_(franchise)\" data-target=\"true\" data-nofollow=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">the A Nightmare on Elm Street film series</a>.</p><p>Ever have a nightmare so real, you'd swear you would have died from it? Frederick Charles Krueger knows the feeling all too well, though he's usually the one inflicting said nightmares. Clawing his way out of the \"Nightmare on Elm Street\" films, though his appearance is taken from the remake, Freddy was a preschool janitor with a penchant for murdering children in his decrepit, terrifying boiler room. Slipping through the fingers of the law, the parents of Springwood formed a lynch mob and burnt the twisted man to death in his own shack. But he returned, demonic and terrifying, to the nightmares of the children, killing them one-by-one with his signature bladed glove, until he cornered his final quarry, only to be drawn into The Entity's horrifying realm. Freddy haunts the dreams of the Survivors, drawing them into his world where he can properly attack them, using his Perks to baffle and confuse their efforts at escape.</p><p>Complexity: Hard</p><h4>The Pig</h4><p>Added on January 23, 2018, released with the <em>SAW</em> chapter, and a guest character from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saw_(franchise)\" data-target=\"true\" data-nofollow=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">the Saw film series</a>.</p><p>One of the first attempted victims of the Jigsaw Killer, Amanda Young escaped the film series' infamous \"reverse bear-trap,\" only to become enamored of the man who'd put in on her head in the first place. Becoming his disciple, Amanda donned the robes and pig mask of Jigsaw, becoming his arms when his own failed him. Becoming her own brand of killer, more merciless and driven than even he was, she eventually fell in her duties, brought down by a policeman's gun, and as she lay dying, dark, twisted tendrils enveloped her and drew her in, giving her another chance to give the gift of life to those who deserved it. And bring death to all the rest. Amanda's twin weapons are her arm blade and the very trap that once ensnared her, giving Survivors the chance to free themselves at the price of losing their focus on their generator objectives. Her perks offerSurvivors choices of how to play the game, giving each a risk-reward that she can exploit.</p><p>Complexity: Intermediate</p><h4>The Ghost Face</h4><p>Added on June 18, 2019, released

After defeating an Invader Armor mid-boss, or hopping into a vacant suit mid-stage, Kirby plows through his enemies with greater ease utilizing Robobot versions of familiar copy abilities. Often times, the Robobot allows Kirby to solve simple puzzles, or reach secret areas, with important collectables as his reward. Code Cubes are the key to facing the boss in each of the 6 main zones in this techno world, but Kirby can also nab a variety of stickers to slap onto his Robobot between stages.</p><p> </p><h2>Plot</h2><p>Napping beneath a tree on the colorful Planet Popstar, Kirby wakes to the sight of extraterrestrial robot invaders from the Haltmann Works Company. Their goal is to harvest resources from the planet. King Dedede\u2019s castle cannons and Meta Knight\u2019s Halberd are no match for the weaponry of the giant spacecraft. It\u2019s once again up to Kirby to save his planet.</p><p>After making his way through the greenery of the Patched Plains, the bustling town of Resolution Road, and the docks of OverloadOcean, Kirby meets Susie, the secretary of the Haltmann Works Company. Failing to defeat the pink puffpall with her mech suit, she reveals plan B. Kirby\u2019s rival, Meta Knight, has been captured and mechanized. Acting as Susie\u2019s new personal security guard, Meta Knight attacks, but is defeated, collapsing into a deep ravine before the Haltmann Works Company\u2019s control can be lifted.</p><p>Soon finding himself in the sleepy city of Rhythm Route, Kirby once again runs into Susie who is surprised by his persistence. This time, she deploys a clone of King Dedede who is soundly defeated.</p><p>Now that the final area supplying the company with power has been shut down, Kirby breaches the mothership to face the powerful defenses of its headquarters, the Access Ark. At the heart of the ark lies the office of President Haltmann himself where Susie again sends a newly upgraded Mecha Knight+ against the pink hero. After his second defeat, Mecha Knight is freed from the company\u2019s control and President Haltmann chooses to reveal himself. He expresses his disappointment with Susie\u2019s performance and dismisses her before revealing that he has reactivated a powerful wish-granting computer named Star Dream. Using a mech suit of his own, President Haltmann engages Kirby in battle similar to that of Susie\u2019s. Haltmann and his suit are bested. Enraged by the \u201cSavages\u201d of Planet Popstar, the greedy President dons a special helmet to take control of the Star Dream. Suddenly, he is betrayed by Susie who forcefully removes the helmet, revealing her plan to sell the wish-granting machine to the highest bidder.</p><p>The Star Dream intervenes, shooting down Susie and possessing President Haltmann, speaking through him. It has been studying the cosmos through the Haltmann Works Company and has found all organic life forms a nuisance. It intends to wipe all life from the universe.</p><p>The Star Dream blasts off into space. Kirby enters a Robobot given to him by Susie who has put her selfishness aside. On his way to confront the massive machine, Kirby encounters Meta Knight one last time who is ready to unite against a common enemy. Fusing with Meta Knight\u2019s Halberd, Kirby becomes the pilot of a giant pink ship ready for a fight.</p><p>After a long battle, Kirby and his Robobot are ejected from a defeated Halberd to finish the confrontation. Kirby loses consciousness, but is saved by his Robobot which tosses him towards Popstar and sheds a tear at the loss of his new organic friend.</p><p>Kirby wakes back on Popstar. The mechanization of his planet has been undone. Friends and enemies rejoice together with the exception of proud Meta Knight aboard his Halberd\u2026</p><p> </p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Like most games in the series, gameplay focuses on copying enemy abilities to traverse platforms, defeat enemies, and solve puzzles. Stages generally focus on expanding the mechanics of a couple specific abilities available to Kirby within the stage and are punctuated by puzzles securing Code Cubes or Stickers.</p><p> </p><h2>Sales</h2><p>The game sold 1.08m copies worldwide as of September 30, 2016.</p>", "expected_release_day": 28, "expected_release_month": 4, "expected_release_quarter": null,

Mac, Linux, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. </p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>The game has a heavy emphasis on using the in-game physics engine to solve traversal puzzles.</p><p>The player must navigate their doughy protagonist to the end of each level by manipulating gravity in various ways, such as pulling on the planks of a boarded up door or weighing down one end of a seesaw for the necessary height to reach a higher platform.</p><p>It is possible for the player to fall off the world: doing so will reset the player at the start of the immediate puzzle area. If they fall off at the designated \"end\" of the level, they will instead fall down at the start of the next. The game features tutorials to help with some of the techniques the player can use, such as raising their arms when moving and jumping to grab onto higher ledges, which they can then pull themselves up onto.</p><h2>System Requirements</h2><h3>PC</h3><table data-max-width=\"true\"><thead><tr><th scope=\"col\">PC Minimum</th><th scope=\"col\">PC

isometric Action RPG paying the tribute to Diablo from 1996. The game recreates the mood and experience of the original hack &amp; slash while introducing some unique mechanics for modern players.</p><p>The game entered the Early Access July 28th, 2016.</p><p> </p><p>Most important features to mention:</p><ul><li><strong>Flexiscope system</strong> \u2013 allowing the player to set the approximated time of each dungeon run, by dividing the story into separate, yet complete chunks similar to Diablo 2 caves.</li><li><strong>The cards system</strong> \u2013 unified system used instead of active skills, passives and inventory. By juggling the available cards slots and mana pool, the player can create builds fitting the current situation. Opening card pane causes slow-motion encouraging to change builds on the go.</li><li><strong>Unique paper graphics</strong> \u2013 Original Diablo experience is recreated by means of the pop-up book, where player and monsters are little figures instead of realistic 3d graphics.</li><li><strong>Freeplay mode</strong> \u2013 After finishing the main story, the player can continue the game in freeplay mode, revisiting the know parts of the dungeon with increasing difficulties (unlocked by playing lower ones).</li><li><strong>Daredevil characters</strong> \u2013 Perma-death mode with global leaderboards. In this mode, the player can create new flexiscope game only on the highest unlocked difficulty.</li></ul><h2>Classes</h2><p>The game revolves around selecting a party of four in the town screen and then delving into a dungeon, of which there are five.</p><h4><strong>Warrior</strong></h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/33/332633/2897931-warrior.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2897931\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/33/332633/2897931-warrior.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2897931\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/33/332633/2897931-warrior.jpg\" srcset=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/33/332633/2897931-warrior.jpg 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"></a></figure><p>Highly armored adventurer focused on Artifact cards (passives).

The stability bestowed upon <a href=\"/ivalice/3035-68/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-68\">Ivalice</a> in the founding days of the Dynast-King has been darkened by the likelihood of war between empires. Rozarria and Archadia seem destined to collide, crushing whatever stands between them.</p><p>Indeed, the Archadian push west toward Rozarria has already consumed Nabradia and its sibling sovereignty, the small, peaceful Kingdom of Dalmasca. <em>FINAL FANTASY XII </em>opens with a quick glimpse of the last throes of pre-Imperial Dalmasca and its desperate fight for freedom, followed by an equally desperate negotiation for peace. In the opening tutorial mission, you participate in a final, fateful attempt to deliver land and king from the clutches of Archadian domination.</p><p>Fast forward two years: In the Dalmascan capital city of Rabanastre, a new consul, Vayne Solidor, son of the Archadian emperor, arrives with a message of hope and renewal for the citizens of that subjugated land. However, his silver-tongued speech doesn\u2019t fully convince <a href=\"/vaan/3005-1850/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1850\">Vaan</a>, an orphaned street boy who sees the Empire as a thieving bully that has robbed his country of wealth and dignity.</p><p>Vaan dreams of escape, seeing his future in the skies as a sky pirate. First, though, he wants some measure of revenge. His bold attempt to infiltrate the Royal Palace during the consul\u2019s inaugural fete to take back some of the treasure that belongs to Dalmasca leads Vaan straight into the clasp of a destiny none could foresee. It is a destiny that includes an exhilarating adventure in the company of sky pirates, a princess, and a great fallen Knight of the Order. As such, the tale begins.</p><h2>Additions</h2><ul><li><strong>Zodiac <a href=\"/job-system/3015-298/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-298\">Job System</a>:</strong> In a huge change to the original game, there are now 12 jobs to choose from. Once a character selects a job, it can never be changed, but each character can also add a second job to further specialize or diversify their abilities.</li><li><strong>Controllable Guest Characters and Espers:</strong> Before, temporary allies (whether human or supernatural) were outside your control. You couldn't move them around, issue them commands, or alter their <a title=\"gambits\" href=\"/gambits/3015-1136/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1136\">gambits</a>. That's all changed. Now you can pilot guests and customize their gambits to your liking. The only thing you can't do is change their equipment. And in addition to being controllable, <a title=\"Espers\" href=\"/eidolon/3015-5069/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5069\">Espers</a> now stick around much longer!</li><li><strong>Reshuffled Treasure Locations:</strong> Treasure chests are in many new locations, are more numerous, and more generous.</li><li><strong>Gambits Unleashed:</strong> Instead of receiving more and more gambits throughout the game, now you can simply buy every single gambit pretty early on. This means you can go ahead and make the gambits you want to make, rather than having to wait till much later in the game for the parameters and conditions your party needs.</li><li><strong>Some Item and Enemy Changes:</strong> While there aren't tons of changes, the stats and acquisition methods of some pieces of gear have changed. A handful of enemies also received minor stat or drop changes.</li><li><strong>Map Overlay:</strong> During exploration or combat, press <strong>L3</strong> to view a map without needing to pause the action.</li><li><strong>Trial Mode: </strong>A lengthy gauntlet of 100 arena battles that uses your save info from the main game.</li><li><strong>New Game+ and New Game-:</strong> A challenging spin on New Game+ modes in which follow-up playthroughs can be made much easier, starting at level 90\u2026or much harder, with EXP gain disabled, and characters forever stuck at their starting levels.</li><li><strong>Speed Mode: </strong>Play at 2x or 4x speed. Greatly reduce the amount of time it takes to traverse large areas, search for treasure, or build up big chains defeating foes.</li><li><strong>Remastered Graphics/Audio: </strong>1080p graphics, modern visual effects, and a re-orchestrated score.</li><li><strong>Auto-save: </strong>The most recent zone transition becomes an automatic save point!</li><li><strong>7.1 Surround Sound</strong></li></ul>", "expected_release_day": 11, "expected_release_month": 7, "expected_release_quarter": null, "expected_release_year": 2017, "guid": "3030-54121", "id": 54121, "image":

The player also has a range of combat abilities, most of which are unlocked as the game progresses.</p><p>Level design heavily revolves around the title's level transformation mechanic. This features allows entire levels to rotate and transform as the player advances, unlocking access to new areas and revealing new challenges.</p><p>Each level is timed with the player awarded up to four 'stars' based on performance relative to a set of baseline metrics. These stars are accumulated as the player advances and can be used to unlock new special attacks. The attacks include a variety of projectile attacks, an airborne stomp attack and upward spinning attack. Scattered throughout the levels are missing 'bytes', items which can be collected to enhance the player's special attacks.</p><p>Bonuses are awarded to the player for each run when exceptional maneuvers are completed, such as destroying several enemies in a single jump and utilizing special attacks in creative ways. The bonuses contribute to the player's final level time.
